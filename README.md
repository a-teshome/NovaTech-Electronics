<img width="1000" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f24bb623-c9a7-4f60-b225-c4decda88e41">

### Company Background
NovaTech Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories, selling via website and mobile app since late 2018. The catalog is centered on leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by performance marketing, SEO, affiliate partnerships, and analytics-led optimization.

### Stakeholder Request
Leadership requested a 2019-2022 walkthrough of sales performance for an upcoming company-wide town hall, focusing on:
- Overall trends and growth rates in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV)
- Loyalty program evaluation: adoption, revenue contribution, and impact on performance, especially during a recent downturn
- Refunds and product performance, with a specific focus on **Apple** products

**Key Question**: How can NovaTech retain as much of the value captured in **2020–2021** as possible in a **2022-style demand environment**? 

# Executive Summary
From **2019 to 2022**, NovaTech processed **108K orders** and generated **$28M in revenue**, with an **overall AOV of $260**. Revenue rose from **$3.87M in 2019** to a **$10.2M peak in 2020 (+163% YoY)**, softened to **$9.13M in 2021 (-10% YoY)**, and then declined to **$4.96M in 2022 (-46% YoY)**. Order volume followed a similar pattern and AOV ranged from **$230 to $300** across the period.

The **loyalty program** evolved from a niche feature to a **core driver of demand and a key stabilizer**. Loyalty’s share of orders grew from **11% in 2019** to **the high-20s in 2020**, and **mid-50s in 2021-2022**, with loyalty contributing **over 50% of revenue** in 2021 and 2022. While loyalty customers were initially lower-value than non-loyalty, their AOV increased over time; by 2022, loyalty AOV (**$245**) exceeded non-loyalty (**$214**), and loyalty members contributed the majority of revenue in a weak year.

Across products, Apple SKUs accounted for **about half of order volume and revenue**, with slightly higher AOV and higher refund rates than non-Apple SKUs. Four products (**Apple AirPods, 27-inch monitors, MacBook Air, and ThinkPad laptops**) generated **$27M (96% of revenue)** and the majority of refund volume. AirPods and monitors provided mid-priced, mid-risk growth, while laptops delivered very high revenue per order but had **refund rates more than double the portfolio average**. Low-risk accessories, such as Samsung charging cables, represented natural add-ons to lift AOV without materially increasing refund risk.

Geographically, **North America** was the core region by revenue and orders, while **APAC** had the h**ighest AOV** and represented a clear opportunity for premium-focused growth. By platform, the **website** handled most high-value orders (and refunds), while the **mobile app** grew as a low-ticket, low-risk channel.

Overall, the analysis supported **continuing and optimizing the loyalty program**, **leaning into high-performing seasons and mid-priced, high-performing products**, and m**itigating refund risk on high-ticket laptops and select Apple SKUs—while using low-risk accessories and targeted iPhone growth as levers to sustain the value created in 2020–2021**.

# Key Insights
## 1. Sales trends and seasonality: 2020 spike, 2022 reset
> 2020 was a breakout year for NovaTech, but by 2022 revenue, orders, and AOV had essentially reset to 2019 levels, with December and September consistently driving the strongest performance across months.

- **2020 breakout**: Peak year with revenue **+163% YoY**, orders **+101% YoY**, and **AOV of $300**.
- **Post-2020 decline**: Revenue fell **10% in 2021** and **46% in 2022**, while orders grew **6% in 2021** then dropped **40% in 2022**. AOV decreased from **$300 → $255 → $230**, back to 2019 baseline.
- Refund rates rose from **6% in 2019** to **9.2% in 2020**, with higher return exposure during the surge. In **2021**, they dropped to **4%**. **2022 refund timestamps are missing** - needs further investigation.

### **Monthly performance and seasonality**:

#### Peak months
- **March 2020** stood out as the sharpest single-month lift, reaching **$720K (+50% MoM)** and **2.4K (+46% MoM) orders** at the start of the pandemic spike, while monthly performance **peaked in December 2020 ($1.25M, 4K orders)**.
- **December** and **September** consistently ranked as the strongest months across years, making them natural anchor points for major campaigns.

#### Weak months
- **February** showed a recurring post-holiday dip, with revenue and orders typically **20-30% below January**. **October** underperformed across years, defining the trough in 2022 with **revenue $178K (-55% MoM)** and **825 orders (-47% MoM)**.

## 2. Loyalty Program performance
> The loyalty program was a key lever for maintaining value post-2020, generating roughly more than half of revenue for 2021 and 2022.

<img width="777" height="185" alt="Loyalty share and aov" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421a0198-b9ea-42e8-9681-f2f9e8381eb2" />

- After a modest start, adoption accelerated from **11% in 2019** to the **high-20s in 2020**, and by **2021** loyalty customers were driving **more than half of the orders and revenue**.
- From mid-2021 onward, loyalty AOV trended above non-loyalty AOV and ended **2022** at **$245 vs $214**, even as overall demand declined.
- **Recent micro-trend**: From **September to December 2022** non-loyalty customers overtook loyalty on **monthly revenue, order volume, and combined AOV** (across these four months), suggesting a potential weakening of the program.
- **Direct** and **Email** channels accounted for **over 90% of loyalty customer aquisition**.

## 3. Product performance
> Four SKUs largely drove the business and most refunds. AirPods and Monitors provided balanced growth, while laptops generated very high revenue per order but had refund rates more than 2x the overall average.

### Apple focus
- **Apple products** generated **$14.3M (51% of revenue)** from **52.7K orders (49% of orders)**, making Apple the largest revenue and volume driver.
- Apple SKUs were more higher risk with **5.9% refund rate** vs **4.1% for non-Apple**. Moreover, **well over half of refund volume (58%)** was tied to Apple SKUs.

### Core SKUs
- **Top revenue driver**: The **Monitor** generated **$9.85M (35% of revenue)** at **$421 AOV** with a **6.2% refund rate**, but were the second largest source of refund volume (**27%0**).
- **High volume, high refund share**: **Apple AirPods** were the workhorse with **45% of all orders**, **$7.74M revenue**, and a **5.4% refund rate**, but they accounted for **49% of all refunds**, likely due to their high order volume.
- **High-value, high risk laptops (MacBook Air and ThinkPad)**: Together contributed **35% of total revenue ($9.5M)** with **AOVs above $1000**, but had **high refund rates (11-12%)** and **14% of total refunds**.
- Taken together, **AirPods, the Monitor, MacBook Air**, and **ThinkPad** accounted for **96% of total revenue (27.1M)** and the majority of refund volume.

### Product opportunities
- The **Samsung Charging Cable Pack** was a popular but low-value product, accounting for **20% of orders** but generating only **2% of revenue**, making it ideal as a **low-risk (refund rate 1.3%)** add-on in bundles (e.g., with laptops) to lift AOV.
- **Apple iPhone** had **AOV $741 and a **moderate refund rate (7.6%)** but very low order volume (**288**): Notably, all iPhone orders were from **non-loyalty customers**, highlighting a high-value segment untapped by the loyalty program.

## 4. Reach
> Revenue was heavily concentrated in North America and a handful of key countries, with APAC standing out as a high-AOV region, where premium-focused tests make strategic sense.

<img width="800" height="250" alt="Regions_countries2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e3dff1f-283b-4c8a-a66f-942451286c3b" />


- **Regions: North America** was the core market, accounting for **more than 50% of orders and revenue**, with **AOV $260**. **APAC** generated **13% of orders and revenue** but had the **highest AOV ($279**), suggesting a more premium mix. Refund rates were broadly similar across regions (roughly **4.2-5.6%**).
- **Top countries: 12 countries out of 196**, generated **80% of total revenue and orders**. Maintaining strong presence and customer loyalty in these markets should be a priority.

# Recommendations
### Marketing & CRM
- Focus loyalty campaigns and promotions in December and September, when demand and loyalty AOV are high.
- Align loyalty aquisition with channel performance by using email (where loyalty already dominates) as the primary engagement channel and direct as the main pool for new loyalty sign-ups.
- Add refund rate metrics for laptops and key Apple products to campaign reporting so performance is evaluated on net revenue, not just top-line sales.
- Run targeted campaigns to grow iPhone sales, focusing on higher-spending segments (loyalty members, high-AOV markets such as the US and JP) to leverage its high AOV ($741).

### Product & Merchandising
- Prioritize AirPods and Monitors in major campaigns; they drive most revenue with mid-range refund rates and are already familiar to customers.
- Reduce laptop refund risk by improving product discovery and configuration support for MacBook Air and ThinkPad.
- Use low-risk accessories as add-ons by building bundles that pair high-ticket devices (like laptops) with low-refund accessories (like Samsung charging cables) to lift AOV while managing refund risk..

### Customer Experience & Operations
- Run a structured analysis of refund reasons for high refund-rate SKUs (laptops, Apple SKUs) and use the findings to refine product information, onboarding flows, and support content.

### Finance & Data
- Investigate potential 2022 refund data gaps and ensure future datasets capture complete refund timestamps for reliable return-rate monitoring.
- Track loyalty KPIs (share of revenue, AOV, refund rate) by cohort over the next 2–3 years to validate the long-term ROI of the loyalty program.
