<img width="1000" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f24bb623-c9a7-4f60-b225-c4decda88e41">

### Company Background
Tech-E-Suite Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories, selling via website and mobile app since late 2018. The catalog is centered on leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by performance marketing, SEO, affiliate partnerships, and analytics-led optimization.

### Stakeholder Request
Leadership requested a 2019-2022 walkthrough of sales performance for an upcoming company-wide town hall, focusing on:
- Overall trends and growth rates in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).
- Loyalty program evaluation: adoption, revenue contribution, and impact on performance, especially during a recent downturn.
- Refunds and product performance, with a specific focus on **Apple** products.

**Key Question**: How can Tech-E-Suite retain as much of the value captured in **2020–2021** as possible in a **2022-style demand environment**? 

# Executive Summary
From **2019 to 2022**, Tech-E-Suite processed **108K orders** and generated **$28M in revenue**, with an **overall AOV of $260**. Revenue rose from **$3.87M in 2019** to a **$10.2M peak in 2020 (+163% YoY)**, softened to **$9.13M in 2021 (-10% YoY)**, and then declined to **$4.96M in 2022 (-46% YoY)**. Order volume followed a similar pattern and AOV ranged from **$230 to $300** across the period.

The **loyalty program** evolved from a niche feature to a **core driver of demand**. Loyalty’s share of orders grew from **12% in 2019** to **the high-30s in 2020**, and **mid-50s in 2021-2022**, with loyalty contributing **over 50% of revenue** in 2021 and 2022. While loyalty customers were initially lower-value than non-loyalty, their AOV rose over time; by 2022, loyalty AOV (**$245**) exceeded non-loyalty (**$214**), and loyalty members contributed the majority of revenue in a weak year.

Across products, Apple SKUs accounted for **about half of order volume and revenue**, with slightly higher AOV and higher refund rates than non-Apple SKUs. **Mid-priced, high-performing products** like **Apple AirPods** and **27-inch monitors** generated substantial revenue with **mid-range refund rates (6-8%)**, while **higher-priced laptops (MacBook Air, ThinkPad)** delivered significant revenue but had **higher refund rates (13–14%)**. Together, these four SKUs accounted for **$27M (96% of total revenue)**, indicating the portfolio was effectively anchored on a small product set. **North America** was the core region by revenue and orders, while **APAC** had the highest AOV and was a clear premium opportunity for expansion. The **website** handled most high-value orders across purchase platforms, while the **mobile app** grew in volume but remained focused on lower-priced purchases.

Overall, the findings support **continuing the loyalty program, leaning into high-performing seasons and mid-priced, high-performing products**, and **tightening controls around high-refund laptops and certain Apple SKUs**.

# Key Insights
## 1. Sales trends and seasonality: 2020 spike, 2022 reset
> 2020 was the breakout year for Tech-E-Suite, but by 2022 revenue, orders, and AOV had effectively reset to 2019 levels, with December and September consistently driving the strongest performance.

- **2020 breakout**: Revenue and orders grew **+163% YoY** and **+101% YoY**, respectively, and **AOV peaked at $300**.
- **Post-2020 decline**: Revenue fell **10% in 2021** and **46% in 2022**, while orders grew **6% in 2021** then dropped **40% in 2022**. AOV declined from **$300 → $255 → $230**, back to 2019 baseline.
- Refund rates rose from **6% in 2019** to **9.2% in 2020**, with higher return exposure during the surge. In **2021**, they dropped to **4%**. **2022 refund timestamps are missing** - needs further investigation.

### **Monthly performance and seasonality**:

#### Peak months
- **March 2020** stood out as the sharpest single-month lift, reaching **$720K (+50% MoM)** and **2.4K (+46% MoM) orders** at the start of the pandemic spike, while monthly performance **peaked in December 2020 ($1.25M, 4K orders**.
- **December** and **September** consistently rank as the strongest months across years, making them natural anchor points for major campaigns.

#### Weak months
- **February** showed a recurring post-holiday dip in revenue and orders. **October** underperformed across years and defined the trough in 2022 with **revenue $178K (-55% MoM)** and **825 orders (-47% MoM)**.

## 2. Loyalty Program performance
> The loyalty program was a key lever for maintaining value post-2020.

- After a modest start, adoption accelerated from **12% in 2019** to the **high-20s in 2020**, and by **2021** loyalty customers were driving **more than half of the orders and revenue**.
- From mid-2021 onward, loyalty AOV trended above non-loyalty AOV and ended **2022** at **$245 vs $214**, even as overall demand declined.

## 3. Product performance
> Four SKUs drive the business: AirPods and monitors provide balanced growth, while laptops generate very high revenue per order but nearly double the average refund rate.
### Apple focus


### Core SKUs
- **Most popular SKU**: **Apple AirPods** with **48.4K orders (45% of orders)** and **$7.74M revenue (AOV $160, refund rate 5.4%)**.
- **Top revenue driver**: **27-in Monitor**, which generated **$9.85M (35% of total revenue)** from **23.4K orders (AOV $421, refund rate 6.2%)**.
- Laptops (**MacBook Air** and **ThinkPad**) were critical revenue drivers, contributing **$9.5M+ revenue (35% of total revenue)** but had high refund **rates (13-14%)**, almost **double the overall average**.
- Combined, these four SKUs accounted for **$27.1M (96% of total revenue)**.

### Opportunities
- The **Samsung Charging Cable Pack** was highlighted as an ideal add-on in bundles with laptops due to its **high volume** (**21.9K orders --> 20% of all orders**) and **low risk** (**MacBook Air** and **ThinkPad**).
- All **Apple iPhone** orders are from **non-loyalty customers**, making them a high-value, underpenetrated opportunity for marketing and loyalty.

At the brand level, **Apple products** generated **$14.3M in revenue (51%)** from **52.7K orders (49%)**, with **AOV $271** but with higher return risk **(refund rate 7.2%)**. **Non-Apple products** accounted for **55.5K orders (51%)** and **$13.9M revenue (49%)**, with an **AOV $250** and a **refund rate of 5.2%**, making them lower-risk on returns compared to Apple.

### Apple Focus

Within the catalog, a few SKUs drove most of the performance. The **27-in 4K monitor** was the top individual revenue driver **($9.85M revenue, 23.4K orders, AOV $421, refund rate of 7.7%)**. The laptops, **MacBook Air ($6.30M, 4K orders, AOV $1,590, refund rate 13%)** and **ThinkPad ($3.21M, 2.9K orders, AOV $1,100, refund rate 14%)**, were very high-value but had refund rates roughly **double the overall average**. **Apple AirPods ($7.74M, 48.4K orders, AOV $160, refund rate 6.7%)** were the most popular product, ideal for attach opportunities. Together, these 4 products accounted for **$27M (96%) in revenue**. Coincidentally, all **Apple iPhone** orders were made by **non-loyalty customers** and contributed **$213K (288 orders, AOV $741, refund rate 9%)**.

## 4. Reach
Regionally, **North America** was the core market, with **$14.6M in revenue (52%)** from **56K orders**, with **AOV $260**. **APAC** generated **$3.65M** from **13.1K orders** but had the **highest AOV ($279**), suggesting a more premium mix and opportunity to test higher-end positioning. Four countries (US, GB, CA and JP) generated over 60% of total revenue.

# Recommendations (by team)
### Marketing & CRM
- Focus loyalty campaigns and promotions in **December** and **September**, when demand and loyalty AOV are both higher.
- Add **refund rate metrics** for laptops and key Apple products to campaign reporting so performance is evaluated on net revenue, not just ROAS.

### Product & Merchandising
- Feature **AirPods and monitors** as lead offers in key seasonal campaigns, given their strong revenue and **mid-range** (**6-8%**) **refund rates**.
- Improve **laptop product discovery and configuration support** to help reduce high refund rates.
- Develop **bundles** pairing **high-ticket devices** (like laptops) with **low-refund accessories** (like cable packs) to increase AOV and improve perceived value.

### Customer Experience & Operations
- Run a structured analysis on refund reasons for high refund-rate SKUs (laptops, Apple SKUs) and use the findings to refine product information and onboarding flows.

### Finance & Data
- Investigate potential 2022 refund data gaps and ensure future datasets capture complete refund timestamps for reliable return-rate monitoring.
  
# Caveats
- **Refund data**: Refund timestamps for 2022 are missing. Refund rate analysis is limited to 2019-2021 only.
