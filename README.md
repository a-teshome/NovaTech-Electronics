## Stakeholder Request
The leadership team requested this analysis, seeking insights into 2019-2022 key sales and performance trends, to support strategic discussions at an upcoming company-wide town hall. Specifically, this analysis covers:
- **Revenue and growth trends**: Evaluating yearly and monthly trends in revenue, average order value (AOV), and order volume.
- **Loyalty program evaluation**: Assessing loyalty program adoption, revenue contribution, and performance impacts across the review period and particularly during the recent company downturn.
- **Refunds and product performance**: Analyzing refund rates and AOV across products, with a specific focus on Apple products.

# Executive Summary: Ecommerce Performance Analysis (2019-2022)
## Overview of Findings
From 2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite generated **$28M in total revenue** from **over 108K orders**, maintaining an **average AOV of $260**. The review period featured significant market-driven fluctuations, especially around the pandemic-driven online shopping surge in 2020, which significantly boosted sales and drove unprecedented annual performance, followed by market normalization by 2022. 
Our loyalty program adoption steadily increased, becoming critical to revenue stabilization, though average loyalty AOV remained lower than non-loyalty. Refund analysis revealed significant impacts from Apple products, representing more than half of total refunded revenue and volume, highlighting an opportunity to improve satisfaction and reduce returns through targeted initiatives. Refunds peaked notably in 2020 amid heightened pandemic demand, and later stabilize. Of note, the absence of refund data for 2022 suggests data recording gaps requirng investigation. 
Overall, the analysis highlights Tech-E-Suite's adaptability to market changes, underscoring targeted opportunities in loyalty initiatives, product management, operational enhancements, and strategic marketing.

# Deep-Dive Insights
## 1. Sales Trends & Growth Rates
### **Yearly Trends & Growth Rates**
From  2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite averaged approximately **7M annually** from **27K orders per year**, with an **average yearly AOV of $260**. The pandemic year, 2020, saw unprecedented performance and growth (**Revenue: $10M (+163% YoY), Orders: 34K (+101% YoY), AOV: $300 (+31% YoY)**), significantly exceeding the 2019 baseline (**Revenue: $4M, Orders: 17K, AOV: $230**). Order volume peaked in 2021 (**36K (+6% YoY)**); however, declining AOV (**$255 (-10% YoY)**) led to decreased revenue (**$9M (-10% YoY)**. By 2022, market normalization became evident, with declines across all key metrics (**Revenue: $5M (-46% YoY), Orders: 22K (-40% YoY), AOV: $230 (-10% YoY)**), bringing performance closer to 2019 baseline/pre-pandemic levels.
### **Monthly Trends & Growth Rates**
**March 2020** had exceptional growth (**Revenue: $720K (+50% MoM), Orders: 2.4K (+46% MoM), AOV: $299 (+3% MoM)**), driven by early-pandemic online purchasing. Following this, monthly AOVs gradually normalized, stabilizing by 2022 at pre-pandemic averages (**~$220-$240**).
#### **Seasonality**
- **Peak Months**: Historically, **December** consistently had the highest monthly sales performance each year—most notably in **December 2020 (Revenue: $1.25M, Orders: 4K, AOV: $311)**. However, there was a notable shift in 2022, when **January** emerged as the top-performing month (**Revenue: $705K, Orders: 3K**), reflecting evolving consumer purchasing behaviors.
- **Low Months**: **October and February** regularly saw lower sales. **October 2022** was particularly weak, with significant YoY declines (**Revenue: $178K, -72% YoY; Orders: 825, down from 2.5K YoY; AOV: $216**). This pronounced decline represents an unusual deviation from expected seasonal patterns that warrants further investigation.

## Loyalty Program Evaluation
Initially comprising just **12% of users and orders in 2019**, loyalty adoption grew significantly surpassing non-loyalty share by 2021 (**56% loyalty vs. 44% non-loyalty**). During the peak-pandemic growth of 2020, loyalty customers contributed substantially (**29% of revenue, 38% of orders**), **becoming essential to revenue stability**. In subsequent downturn periods (particularly 2022), loyalty members showed resilience, consistently accounting for a greater proportion of total revenue (**55%**) and orders (**52%**) compared to non-loyalty members. However, throughout the analysis period, loyalty customers averaged slightly lower AOVs (**$240**) compared to non-loyalty (**$275**). Nonetheless, the steady revenue stream provided by loyalty customers, especially during challenging market conditions, validates continued strategic investment in the loyalty program.

## Refund Impact
Refunds represented **5% of total orders** (~ 5K orders) and **8% of total revenue** (~ $2M) from 2019 to 2022. Refund rates peaked significantly in 2020 (**9% orders, 13% revenue**), due the substantial pandemic-driven sales surge, before stabilizing in 2021. Notably, zero refunds were reported for 2022, indicating possible data collection or operational gaps requiring investigation.
### By Product
- **Highest Refund Rate**: High-value laptops (**MacBook Air, ThinkPad**) consistently had the highest refund rates (**~12%**).
- **Highest Refund Volume**: Popular products (**Apple AirPods, 4K Gaming Monitor**) represented the majority of refund volume (**49% and 27% of total refunds**, respectively), likely due to their high overall sales.
- **Highest Refund Value**: High-priced items (**MacBook Air, 4K Gaming Monitor**) significantly impacted redunded revenue (**33% and 28% of total refunded revenue**, respectively).

### Apple Products Highlight:
Apple products (**MacBook Air, Apple AirPods**, and **Apple iPhone**) significantly impacted refunds, collectively accounting for **53% of total refunded revenue** and **58% of refunded orders** from 2019-2022:
- **AirPods**: Generated substantial volume (**~48K units sold**) with lower AOVs (**$160**). Refund volumes (**~2,600 refunds, 5.4% refund rate**) exceeded company average.
- **MacBook Air laptops**: Offered significantly higher AOVs (**~$1,588**) but also had a notably higher refund rate (**11%**).
- **Apple iPhones**: Sold in lower volumes (**~288 units**) but had high AOVs (**$741**) and low refund rates (**~7.6%**)
Given these insights, there is an opportunity to reassess product-specific customer satisfaction, return policies, and quality control processes, particularly for higher-value items.

# Strategic Recommendations
**Product Team**:
- Investigate refund drivers and customer dissatisfaction for high refund-rate products (**MacBook Air, ThinkPad laptops**).
  
**Operations Team**:
- Conduct audits on refund-data collection and reporting processes to determine reasons behing zero-refund records in 2022.
- Streamline returns handling and customer interaction procedures, especially during peak demand periods, to proactively reduce refund volume and rates.
  
**Marketing Team**:
- Strategically enhance loyalty programs to incentivize higher AOVs among loyalty customers through focused product bundles and exclusive promotions.
- Develop targeted marketing and educational campaigns around high-refund-volume products (**Apple AirPods, Gaming Monitor**) to clearly set customer expectations and improve user satisfaction.
  
**Cross-functional Recommendation**:
- Conduct a detailed, cross-team investigation into October 2022's substantial performance drop, evaluating product-level sales, regional issues, and marketing effectiveness aiming to identify and mitigate risks ahead of any future challenging periods.
