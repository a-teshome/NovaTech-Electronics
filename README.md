<img width="1000" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f24bb623-c9a7-4f60-b225-c4decda88e41">

### Company Background
NovaTech Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories, selling via website and mobile app since late 2018. The catalog is centered on leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by performance marketing, SEO, affiliate partnerships, and analytics-led optimization.

### Stakeholder Request
Leadership requested a 2019-2022 walkthrough of sales performance for an upcoming company-wide town hall, focusing on:
- Overall trends and growth rates in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).
- Loyalty program evaluation: adoption, revenue contribution, and impact on performance, especially during a recent downturn.
- Refunds and product performance, with a specific focus on **Apple** products.

**Key Question**: How can NovaTech retain as much of the value captured in **2020–2021** as possible in a **2022-style demand environment**? 

# Executive Summary
From **2019 to 2022**, NovaTech processed **108K orders** and generated **$28M in revenue**, with an **overall AOV of $260**. Revenue rose from **$3.87M in 2019** to a **$10.2M peak in 2020 (+163% YoY)**, softened to **$9.13M in 2021 (-10% YoY)**, and then declined to **$4.96M in 2022 (-46% YoY)**. Order volume followed a similar pattern and AOV ranged from **$230 to $300** across the period.

The **loyalty program** evolved from a niche feature to a **core driver of demand**. Loyalty’s share of orders grew from **12% in 2019** to **the high-30s in 2020**, and **mid-50s in 2021-2022**, with loyalty contributing **over 50% of revenue** in 2021 and 2022. While loyalty customers were initially lower-value than non-loyalty, their AOV rose over time; by 2022, loyalty AOV (**$245**) exceeded non-loyalty (**$214**), and loyalty members contributed the majority of revenue in a weak year.

Across products, Apple SKUs accounted for **about half of order volume and revenue**, with slightly higher AOV and higher refund rates than non-Apple SKUs. **Mid-priced, high-performing products** like **Apple AirPods** and **27-inch monitors** generated substantial revenue with **mid-range refund rates (6-8%)**, while **higher-priced laptops (MacBook Air, ThinkPad)** delivered significant revenue but had **higher refund rates (~12%)**. Together, these four SKUs accounted for **$27M (96% of total revenue)**, indicating the portfolio was effectively anchored on a small product set. **North America** was the core region by revenue and orders, while **APAC** had the highest AOV and was a clear premium opportunity for expansion. The **website** handled most high-value orders across purchase platforms, while the **mobile app** grew in volume but remained focused on lower-priced purchases.

Overall, the findings support **continuing the loyalty program, leaning into high-performing seasons and mid-priced, high-performing products**, and **tightening controls around high-refund laptops and certain Apple SKUs**.

# Key Insights
## 1. Sales trends and seasonality: 2020 spike, 2022 reset
> 2020 was the breakout year for NovaTech, but by 2022 revenue, orders, and AOV had effectively reset to 2019 levels, with December and September consistently driving the strongest performance.

- **2020 breakout**: Revenue and orders grew **+163% YoY** and **+101% YoY**, respectively, and **AOV peaked at $300**.
- **Post-2020 decline**: Revenue fell **10% in 2021** and **46% in 2022**, while orders grew **6% in 2021** then dropped **40% in 2022**. AOV declined from **$300 → $255 → $230**, back to 2019 baseline.
- Refund rates rose from **6% in 2019** to **9.2% in 2020**, with higher return exposure during the surge. In **2021**, they dropped to **4%**. **2022 refund timestamps are missing** - needs further investigation.

### **Monthly performance and seasonality**:

#### Peak months
- **March 2020** stood out as the sharpest single-month lift, reaching **$720K (+50% MoM)** and **2.4K (+46% MoM) orders** at the start of the pandemic spike, while monthly performance **peaked in December 2020 ($1.25M, 4K orders**.
- **December** and **September** consistently rank as the strongest months across years, making them natural anchor points for major campaigns.

#### Weak months
- **February** showed a recurring post-holiday dip in revenue and orders. **October** underperformed across years and defined the trough in 2022 with **revenue $178K (-55% MoM)** and **825 orders (-47% MoM)**.

## 2. Loyalty Program performance
> The loyalty program was a key lever for maintaining value post-2020.

- After a modest start, adoption accelerated from **12% in 2019** to the **high-20s in 2020**, and by **2021** loyalty customers were driving **more than half of the orders and revenue**.
- From mid-2021 onward, loyalty AOV trended above non-loyalty AOV and ended **2022** at **$245 vs $214**, even as overall demand declined.
- **Recent micro-trend**: From **September to December 2022** non-loyalty customers overtook loyalty on **monthly revenue, order volume, and combined AOV** (across these four months), suggesting a potential weakening of the program.
- **Direct** and **Email** channels accounted for **over 90% of loyalty customer aquisition**.

## 3. Product performance
> Four SKUs largely drive the business: AirPods and Monitors provide balanced growth, while laptops generate very high revenue per order but have nearly double the average refund rate.

### Apple focus
- **Apple products** generated **$14.3M (51% of revenue)** from **52.7K orders (49% of orders)**, making Apple the largest driver of both revenue and volume, albeit at a high risk with **Apple refund rate of 7.2%** vs **5.2% for non-Apple products**.

### Core SKUs
- **Most popular SKU**: **Apple AirPods** with **48.4K orders (45% of orders)** and **$7.74M revenue (AOV $160, refund rate 5.4%)**.
- **Top revenue driver**: **Monitors**, which generated **$9.85M (35% of total revenue)** from **23.4K orders (AOV $421, refund rate 6.2%)**.
- **High-value, high-risk laptops (MacBook Air and ThinkPad**) were critical revenue drivers, contributing **35% of total revenue ($9.5M)** but were high risk, with **refund rates (~12%)** almost **double the overall average**.
- Combined, **AirPods, Monitors, MacBook Air**, and **ThinkPad** accounted for **96% of total revenue (27.1M)**.

### Opportunities
- **Bundles and add-ons**: The **Samsung Charging Cable Pack** was a popular but low-value product, accounting for **20% of all orders** but generating only **2% of revenue**. It stood out as an ideal **low-risk (refund rate 1.7%)** add-on in bundles (e.g., with laptops) to raise AOV.
- **Untapped iPhone potential**: Notably, only **non-loyalty customers** purchased **Apple iPhones**, suggesting a high-value **(AOV $741)** untapped potential for marketing and loyalty.

## 4. Reach
> Revenue is heavily concentrated in North America and a handful of key countries, with APAC standing out as a high-AOV region, where premium-focused tests make strategic sense.

<img width="800" height="250" alt="Regions_countries" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3758f6fa-86fc-4387-b9ed-d95df08f755e" />

- **Regions: North America** was the core market, accounting for **more than 50% of orders and revenue**, with **AOV $260**. **APAC** generated roughly **12% of orders and revenue** but had the **highest AOV ($279**), suggesting a more premium mix. Refund rates were broadly similar across regions (**refund rate ranged from 4.2 - 5.6%**).
- **Top countries: 12 countries** out of 196, generated **80% of total revenue and orders**. Maintaining strong presence and customer loyalty in these markets should be a priority.

# Recommendations (by team)
### Marketing & CRM
- Focus loyalty campaigns and promotions in **December** and **September**, when demand and loyalty AOV are both higher.
- Add **refund rate metrics** for laptops and key Apple products to campaign reporting so performance is evaluated on net revenue.
- Test targeted campaigns to **grow iPhone sales**, focusing on higher-spending segments (loyalty members, key high-AOV markets such as the US and JP) to leverage its high AOV (~$741).
- Align loyalty aquisition efforts to channel performance by using email, where loyalty already dominates, as the primary engagement channel and direct as the main pool for new loyalty sign-ups

### Product & Merchandising
- Feature **AirPods and 27" Monitors** as lead offers in key seasonal campaigns, given their strong revenue contribution and mid-range refund rates (6-8%).
- Improve **laptop product discovery and configuration support** to help reduce high refund rates (~12%).
- Develop **bundles** pairing **high-ticket devices** (like laptops) with **low-refund accessories** (like cable packs) to increase AOV and improve perceived value.

### Customer Experience & Operations
- Run a structured analysis of refund reasons for high refund-rate SKUs (laptops, Apple SKUs) and use the findings to refine product information and support content.

### Finance & Data
- Investigate potential 2022 refund data gaps and ensure future datasets capture complete refund timestamps for reliable return-rate monitoring.
- Track loyalty KPIs (share of revenue, AOV, refund rate) by cohort over the next 2–3 years to validate the long-term ROI of the loyalty program.
  
# Caveats
- **Refund data**: Refund timestamps for 2022 are missing. Refund rate analysis is limited to 2019-2021 only.
