<img width="1000" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f24bb623-c9a7-4f60-b225-c4decda88e41">

### Company Background
Tech-E-Suite Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories, selling via website and mobile app since late 2018. Our catalog is centered on leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by performance marketing, SEO, affiliate partnerships, and analytics-led optimization.

### Stakeholder Request
Leadership requested a 2019-2022 walkthrough of order volume and revenue trends for an upcoming company-wide town hall, focusing on:
- **Revenue and growth trends:** overall, yearly, and monthly trends in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).
- **Loyalty program evaluation:** adoption, revenue contribution, and impact on performance, especially during the recent downturn.
- **Refunds and product performance:** refund rates and AOV across products, with a specific lens on **Apple** products. 

# Executive Summary
From **2019 to 2022**, Tech-E-Suite processed **108K orders** and generated **$28M in revenue**, with an **overall AOV of $260**. During this time, the company moved through distinct phases. Revenue rose from **$3.87M in 2019** to a **$10.2M peak in 2020 (+163% YoY)**, softened to **$9.13M in 2021 (-10% YoY)**, and then declined to **$4.96M in 2022 (-46% YoY)**. Order volume followed the same pattern, and AOV ranged from **$230 to $300** across this period.

The **loyalty program** transitioned from a niche feature to a **core driver of demand**. Loyalty’s share grew from **12% in 2019** to **over 50% of orders and revenue by 2021**, a level that was sustained through **2022**. While loyalty customers were initially lower-value and higher-refund than non-loyalty, their AOV rose steadily, and by 2022 loyalty AOV (**$245**) exceeded non-loyalty (**$214**), with loyalty members contributing the majority of revenue in a weak year.

**Product performance** was concentrated in a small set of SKUs and brands. Apple products accounted for **half of order volume and revenue**, with slightly higher AOV and refund rates than non-Apple SKUs. **Mid-priced, high-performing products** such as **Apple AirPods** and **27-inch monitors** generated substantial revenue with **refund rates of 6-8%**, while **higher-priced laptops (MacBook Air, ThinkPad)** delivered significant top-line but had **13–14% refund rates**. Regionally, **North America** was the core revenue and order volume region, while **APAC** showed the highest AOV and an opportunity for expansion. Across platforms, the **website** handled majority of transactions with high AOV and higher refund rates, while the **mobile app** grew in volume but remained focused on lower-priced purchases.

Overall, the data supports **continuing the loyalty program, leaning into high-performing seasons and mid-priced, high-performing products**, and **tightening controls around high-refund laptops and certain Apple SKUs**.

# Deep-Dive Insights
## 1. Sales trends and growth rates
- In **2019**, Tech-E-Suite generated **$3.87M** from **16.8K orders** at an **AOV of $230**. Monthly revenue generally ranged between **$250K and $460K**, 
> with no extreme month-over-month swings, and served as the pre-pandemic baseline.
- In **2020**, revenue surged to **$10.15M (+163% YoY)** on **33.8K orders (+101% YoY)**, and **AOV increased to $300 (+30% vs 2019)**. Revenue rose sharply in **March 2020 (~$720k, +50% MoM)** and remained above the 2019–2022 monthly average for most of the year, **peaking at ~$1.25M in Dec-2020**, more than 3x a typical 2019 month.
- In **2021**, order volume increased further to **35.9K (+6% YoY)**, but revenue declined to **$9.13M (−10% YoY)** and **AOV dropped to $255 (−15% vs 2020)**, as customer mix shifted toward lower-priced items.

- In **2022**, both revenue and order volume declined to **$4.96M (−46% YoY)** and **21.6K (−40% YoY)**, respectively, with **AOV** returning back to 2019 levels **($230**). Revenue trended downward across 2022; Oct-2022 was the lowest revenue month ($178K, -55% MoM) across the four-year period.

2020 represented an upside scenario, 2022 a downside scenario, and 2021 the most representative baseline for forward planning.

### Monthly trends and seasonality

- **December** and **September** consistently outperformed, with across years averages **10–18% above** the monthly order volume average across all four years (2.3K orders), indicating they were natural anchor points for major campaigns. Like revenue, monthly order volume peaked in **Dec 2020 (4K orders, +46% MoM)**.
- **February** and **October** consistently underperformed. Similar to revenue, order volume was lowest in **October 2022 (825 orders, -47% MoM)**, combining seasonal weakness with the broader 2022 downturn.

## 2. Loyalty Program performance

### Adoption and revenue contribution
- Loyalty's orders and revenue share grew from 11% in 2019 to the high-30s in 2020 and then to mid-50s in 2021-2022, reflecting a clear, positive YoY trend in program penetration. In 2021 and 2022, loyalty accounted for over half of the year's revenue, even in the downturn of 2022.

### Customer value and refunds
- **Aggregated AOV and refund rates**: From 2019 to 2022, **loyalty** orders had an **AOV of $240** and a **refund rate of 6.2%**, compared to non-loyalty with **higher AOv ($275)** and lower **refund rate (4.1%)**.
- **Year-level trends**:
  - Non-loyalty orders were more expensive **(AOV $233 vs loyalty AOV: $207)** in **2019** and in **2020 (non-loyalty AOV: $345, loyalty AOV:$228)**, as higher-priced pandemic purchases skewed toward non-loyalty customers.
  - Compared with 2020, in **2021**, non-loyalty **AOV declined ($261)** but remained higher than loyalty AOV, which increased to **$249**.
  - By **2022**, loyalty AOV reached **$245**, while non-loyalty AOV continued to decline to **$214**.

Shipping and delivery operations were uniform across segments.

## 3. Product performance

### Brand-level
- Across all four years, **Apple products** drove a large share of both revenue and order volume, generating **$14.3M in revenue (51%)** from **52.7K orders (49%)**, with **AOV of $271** but with higher return risk **(refund rate 7.2%)**.
- **Non-Apple products** accounted for **55.5K orders (51%)** and **$13.9M revenue (49%)**, with an **AOV of $250** and a **refund rate of 5.2%**, making them comparably lower-risk.

### Product-level

- **Monitors** were the top revenue contributors among individual SKUs, generating **$9.85M in revenue** from **23.4K orders**, with **AOV of $421** and a **refund rate of 7.7%**.
- Laptops were very high-value but carried elevated refund risk, with refund rates double the overall average.
  - **MacBooks**: **$6.30M** in revenue from **3,964** orders with **AOV $1,590** and **refund rate 13%**.
  - **ThinkPad**: **$3.21M** in revenue from **2,916** orders with **AOV $1,100** and **refund rate 14%**.
- **Apple iPhone** accounted for** $213K revenue** from **288 orders**, with **Aov $741** and **refund rate 9%**.

Shipping and delivery were consistent across SKUs, thus differences in performance were not driven operational delays.

## 4. Regional performance
- **North America** formed the core of the business in both order volume and revenue, generating **$14.6M in revenue** from **56K orders**, with **AOV of $260**
- **APAC** had the highest AOV (**Revenue $3.65M, Orders 13.1K orders, AOV $279**), suggesting opportinities for premium positioning

## 5. Purchase platform
- The primary purchase platform was the **website**, which was the main source of high-value transactions through 2021-2022.
- The **mobile app** grew in usage but was primarily used for smaller, lower-priced purchases.
- **Refund rates by platform** were highter on the website than on the app, consistent with the websites concentration of higher-priced and higher-risk products, like laptops.

# Recommendations (by team)
## Marketing & CRM
- Focus promotions and campaigns for loyalty members in **December** and **September**, combining high purchase propensity with higher loyalty AOV.
- Consider integrating **refund rate KPIs** into campaign performance dashboards so that volume growth is evaluated jointly with **post-purchase behavior**.
## Product & Merchandising
- Prioritize **mid-ticket hero products** as the core of **promotional calendars**, using **laptops as high-intent, more selectively promoted items**.
- Improve **product discovery and configuration support** for laptops (comparisons, spec explanations, compatibility guidance) to address potential **expectation gaps** that may be driving returns.
- Develop **bundles** that pair **high-ticket devices** with **low-refund accessories and support services** to increase **perceived value** and potentially lower **refund incidence**.

### Operations, Customer Experience & Data
- Conduct a structured **deep dive into refund drivers** for **high-ticket laptops** and **Apple SKUs** using **reason codes and support transcripts**.
- Implement targeted **post-purchase journeys** for **high-value orders** (proactive setup help, check-ins) to **reduce avoidable returns**.
- **Validate and backfill 2022 refund data** and **standardize country codes** to close known **data gaps** and enable more robust **longitudinal and regional analysis**.

## Caveats & Next Steps
### Caveats
- The dataset covers **2019-2022 only**.
- **Refund timestamps are not populated for 2022**, so **refund-rate metrics for that year cannot be interpreted**.
- **Cost, margin, and marketing spend** are not included, so this is a **revenue-focused view** rather than a **profitability analysis**.
- Incomplete **country-to-region mapping** means region-level metrics exclude a subset of orders.

### Next Steps
- Refresh the dataset with **2023-2024 orders**, complete **refund information for 2022 onward**, and fully mapped **country/region data**, then rerun the core t**ime-series and segmentation analysis**.
- Extend the reporting stack to **margin-based and campaign-level views** to assess **profitability**, not just revenue, across **products, regions, and customer segments**.
- Develop a follow-on **customer analytics project** focused on **cohort, repeat behavior, and loyalty tenure** to better quantify **lifetime value** and inform long-term **retention strategy**.
