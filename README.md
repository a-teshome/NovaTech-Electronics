### Company Background
Tech-E-Suite Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories and sells via website and mobile app since late 2018. Our catalog is built around leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by digital marketing, SEO, affiliates and analytics-led decision-making.

### Stakeholder Request
The leadership team requested a structured view of sales performance from **2019 to 2022** to inform an upcoming company-wide town hall, with focus on:
- **Revenue and growth trends:** yearly and monthly trends in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).
- **Loyalty program evaluation:** adoption, revenue contribution, and impact, especially during the recent downturn.
- **Refunds and product performance:** refund rates and AOV across products, with focus on **Apple** products. 

# Executive Summary
From 2019 and 2022, Tech-E-Suite electronics moved from rapid expansion to a pronounced slowdown. Orders increased from 16.8K in 2019 to a **peak of 35.9K in 2021**, before falling to 21.6K in 2022. Revenue followed a similar arc, rising from $3.87M (2019), **peaking to $10.2M (2020)**, softening to $9.13M (2021), and then dropping to $4.96M (2022). Across the four years, overall **AOV** averaged around **$260,** with yearly AOV ranging from $230 to $300.

The **loyalty program** scaled rapidly and is now central to the business. Loyalty customers grew from **12% of orders in 2019** to **over 50% of orders and revenue by 2021-2022.** In 2022, they delivered a **higher AOV (~$245)** than non-loyalty customers (~$214), helping cushion the downturn.

Product performance is mixed. **Apple products** drive roughly **45% of orders** but around **29% of revenue**, with **lower AOV (around $163)** and slightly higher refund rates than non-Apple products. High-end laptops (MacBook Air, ThinkPad) are commercially critical but carry **double-digit refund rates.** Regionally, **North America** leads in revenue, while **APAC** shows the highest AOV, indicating targeted regional opportunities.

## High Level Insights
From 2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite generated **$28M in total revenue** from **over 108K orders**, maintaining an **average AOV of $260**. The review period featured significant market-driven fluctuations, especially around the pandemic-driven online shopping surge in 2020, which significantly boosted sales and drove unprecedented annual performance, followed by market normalization by 2022. 
Our loyalty program adoption steadily increased, becoming critical to revenue stabilization, though average loyalty AOV remained lower than non-loyalty. Refund analysis revealed significant impacts from Apple products, representing more than half of total refunded revenue and volume, highlighting an opportunity to improve satisfaction and reduce returns through targeted initiatives. Refunds peaked notably in 2020 amid heightened pandemic demand, and later stabilize. Of note, the absence of refund data for 2022 suggests data recording gaps requirng investigation. 
Overall, the analysis highlights Tech-E-Suite's adaptability to market changes, underscoring targeted opportunities in loyalty initiatives, product management, operational enhancements, and strategic marketing.

## Deep-Dive Insights
### 1. Sales Trends & Growth Rates
#### **Yearly Trends & Growth Rates**
From  2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite averaged approximately **7M annually** from **27K orders per year**, with an **average yearly AOV of $260**. The pandemic year, 2020, saw unprecedented performance and growth (**Revenue: $10M (+163% YoY), Orders: 34K (+101% YoY), AOV: $300 (+31% YoY)**), significantly exceeding the 2019 baseline (**Revenue: $4M, Orders: 17K, AOV: $230**). Order volume peaked in 2021 (**36K (+6% YoY)**); however, declining AOV (**$255 (-10% YoY)**) led to decreased revenue (**$9M (-10% YoY)**. By 2022, market normalization became evident, with declines across all key metrics (**Revenue: $5M (-46% YoY), Orders: 22K (-40% YoY), AOV: $230 (-10% YoY)**), bringing performance closer to 2019 baseline/pre-pandemic levels.
#### **Monthly Trends & Growth Rates**
**March 2020** had exceptional growth (**Revenue: $720K (+50% MoM), Orders: 2.4K (+46% MoM), AOV: $299 (+3% MoM)**), driven by early-pandemic online purchasing. Following this, monthly AOVs gradually normalized, stabilizing by 2022 at pre-pandemic averages (**~$220-$240**).
##### **Seasonality**
- **Peak Months**: Historically, **December** consistently had the highest monthly sales performance each year—most notably in **December 2020 (Revenue: $1.25M, Orders: 4K, AOV: $311)**. However, there was a notable shift in 2022, when **January** emerged as the top-performing month (**Revenue: $705K, Orders: 3K**), reflecting evolving consumer purchasing behaviors.
- **Low Months**: **October and February** regularly saw lower sales. **October 2022** was particularly weak, with significant YoY declines (**Revenue: $178K, -72% YoY; Orders: 825, down from 2.5K YoY; AOV: $216**). This pronounced decline represents an unusual deviation from expected seasonal patterns that warrants further investigation.

### 2. Loyalty Program Performance
Initially accounting for just **12% of revenue and orders in 2019**, loyalty program adoption accelerated rapidly. By **2021**, loyalty orders and revenue had surpassed non-loyalty, reaching **55% of orders** and **53% of revenue**, respectively. During the peak pandemic year (**2020**), loyalty customers became critical to revenue stability, contributing **29% of revenue** and **38% of orders**.
While the average order value (**AOV**) for loyalty customers trailed non-loyalty customers from **2019 to 2022** — **$240** vs. **$275**, respectively — a year-by-year view reveals a promising shift. By **2022**, loyalty AOV had **surpassed** non-loyalty, with loyalty customers spending an average of **$30 more per order** (**$245** vs. **$214**). This higher monthly AOV was sustained **from April 2021 through September 2022**.
Amid **2022’s market normalization** following pandemic-driven surges, loyalty customers continued to show **notable resilience**, representing a consistent majority share of both **revenue (55%)** and **orders (52%)**.
