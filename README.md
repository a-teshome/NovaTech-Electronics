## Business Request
The leadership team requested an analysis to support an upcoming company-wide town hall, seeking insights into 2019-2022 order trends. The analysis categorizes findings into **pre-pandemic (2019)**, **peak-pandemic (2020)**, and **post-pandemic (2021-2022)** consumer purchasing behaviors and market shifts. Examining these trends in the context of these distinct periods will enable Tech-E-Suite to strategically target revenue growth, enhance customer retention, optimize the loyalty program, reduce refund-related costs, anticipate future market conditions, and effectively adapt to evolving consumer preferences as the market normalizes.
Specifically, the analysis addresses:
- **Revenue and growth trends**: Yearly and monthly trends in revenue, average order value (AOV), and order volumes.
- **Product and regional segmentation**: Evaluation of market-specific dynamics and identification of top-performing products.
- **Loyalty program evaluation**: Review of adoption, impacts on revenue, and performance during recent company downturn.
- **Refunds**: Examined at the product-level, with a particular focus on Apple products.
  
> Specifically, the analysis should address (from requirements gathering):
> - Overall sales trends evaluation: Measured by monthly and yearly growth rates in sales revenue, average order value (AOV), and order counts.
> - Product and regional performance analysis: Identifies market-specific trends and key product performance dynamics.
> - Loyalty program performance evaluation: Measured by sales, order counts, and AOV.

# Executive Summary
## Overview
Between **2019 and 2022**, Tech-E-Suite Electronics generated approximately **$28M in total revenue** from over **108K orders**, with an **Average Order Value (AOV)** of **$260**. To understand performance dynamics and extract actionable insights, this analysis segments the timeline into three key periods:
- **Pre-pandemic (2019)**: Serves as a baseline for normal customer behavior and operational performance.
- **Peak-pandemic (2020)**: Captures pandemic-driven shifts in digital purchasing and demand spikes.
- **Post-pandemic (2021-2022)**: Reflects market normalization.
Exploring trends across these periods allows Tech-E-Suite to distinguish between **temporary spikes and sustainable growth patterns**, identify when and why customer behaviors changed, and evaluate the **lasting impacts of pandemic-driven shifts**. The temporal lens is critical for:
- Identifying which gains to protect (e.g., loyalty adoption)
- Highlighting risk factors (e.g., sharp AOV declines)
- Pinpointing product categories or customer segments that responded differently during volatile versus stable conditions.

Understanding these pandemic-driven inflection points supports smarter planning for pricing strategies, inventory optimization, and customer retention in a post-pandemic digital retail environment.

# Deep-Dive Insights
## Revenue and Growth Trends
- **Yearly summary**: From 2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite averaged around **$7M** in revenue per year from **27K** orders, with an **AOV of $260** per year. The peak-pandemic year, 2020, experienced exceptional growth, with the highest annual revenue (**$10M**) and AOV (**$300**), significantly above pre-pandemic 2019 (**$4M revenue, 17K orders, AOV $230**). While the number of orders peaked in 2021 (**36K**), revenue declined to **$9M** driven by lower AOV (**$255**). By 2022 revenue (**$5M**), orders (**22K**), and AOV (**$230**) returned closer to pre-pandemic levels.
- **Growth rates**: Peak-pandemic conditions in 2020 showed extraordinary increases (**+163% revenue, +101% orders, +31% AOV** YoY). However, post-pandemic performance was mixed, with modest order growth in 2021 (**+6%**) but decreasing revenue (**-10%**) due to lower AOV (**-15%**). By 2022, significant declines across all metrics (**-46% revenue, -40% orders, -10% AOV**) occurred, reflecting market normalization.

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Peak periods**: December generated the highest monthly sales per year from 2019 to 2021, peaking in 2020 (**$1M for 4K orders, AOV $311**) except in 2022 when January emerged as the strongest sales month with almost 3x the revenue and more than double the Dec 2022 orders and a similar AOV across both months.
- **Seasonal lows**: October and February consistently showed weaker sales performance. October notably declined from **$632K in 2021** to only **$178K in 2022** (orders dropping from 2,501 to 825). February similarly demonstrated weaker performance (**$473K in 2022, down from $708K in 2021**).

- **Order volume vs. AOV trends**: Peak-pandemic (2020) had elevated order counts and high AOV consistently across months. Post-pandemic, order volumes and AOV generally declined. Notably, AOVs in 2022 stabilized around pre-pandemic levels (**~$220-240**), emphasizing normalization in consumer spending behavior.
- **Notable exception**: March 2020 experienced a significant surge (**$720K, +162%** compared to March 2019), reflecting early pandemic-driven shifts to online purchasing.

## Product and Regional Segmentation
### Product Performance
- **Strong, consistent products**: The 27In 4K Gaming Monitor was the top revenue earner ($10M, 35% of total), despite fewer orders (22% of total). Apple Airpods were the most popular product by order volume (45% of total orders) and the second highest revenue earner ($8M, 28%).
- **Niche products**: Apple iPhone's low revenue but high AOV ($741) highlights its potential for targeted growth.

- **Revenue contribution**: Loyalty-driven sales significantly grew, accounting for nearly **55% of total revenue by 2022**, highlighting the program's effectiveness in enhancing customer value and revenue.

## Refund Impact
>> Angie: For refunds and average order value, would like to focus on how these metrics compare across Apple products. Also include number of refunds as a metric.

Refunds represented **5% of total orders** (~5K orders) and **8% of total revenue** (~$2M) from 2019 to 2022. Rates significantly peakied in 2020 (**9% orders, 13% revenue**) likely due to pandemic-driven sales spike, before stabilizing in 2021.
> The data reported zero refunds for 2022.
### By Product

- **Highest refund volume**: **Apple AirPods** and the **27In 4K Gaming Monitor** had the highest overall refund volumes, representing **49% and 27%**, respectively, of total refunds issued. This is likely due to their high sales volumes.
