### Company Background
Tech-E-Suite Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories and sells via website and mobile app since late 2018. Our catalog is built around leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by digital marketing, SEO, affiliates and analytics-led decision-making.

### Stakeholder Request
The leadership team requested a structured view of sales performance from **2019 to 2022** to inform an upcoming company-wide town hall, with focus on:
- **Revenue and growth trends:** yearly and monthly trends in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).
- **Loyalty program evaluation:** adoption, revenue contribution, and impact, especially during the recent downturn.
- **Refunds and product performance:** refund rates and AOV across products, with focus on **Apple** products. 

# Executive Summary
From 2019 and 2022, Tech-E-Suite electronics moved from rapid expansion to a pronounced slowdown. Orders increased from 16.8K in 2019 to a **peak of 35.9K in 2021**, before falling to 21.6K in 2022. Revenue followed a similar arc, rising from $3.87M (2019), **peaking to $10.2M (2020)**, softening to $9.13M (2021), and then dropping to $4.96M (2022). Across the four years, overall **AOV** averaged around **$260,** with yearly AOV ranging from $230 to $300.

The **loyalty program** scaled rapidly and is now central to the business. Loyalty customers grew from **12% of orders in 2019** to **over 50% of orders and revenue by 2021-2022.** In 2022, they delivered a **higher AOV (~$245)** than non-loyalty customers (~$214), helping cushion the downturn.

Product performance is mixed. **Apple products** drive roughly **45% of orders** but around **29% of revenue**, with **lower AOV (around $163)** and slightly higher refund rates than non-Apple products. High-end laptops (MacBook Air, ThinkPad) are commercially critical but carry **double-digit refund rates.** Regionally, **North America** leads in revenue, while **APAC** shows the highest AOV, indicating targeted regional opportunities.

## High Level Insights

- By **2020,** the program showed rapid adoption, with loyalty share rising to **38% of orders** and **29% of revenue.**
- In **2021,** the business flipped into a loyalty-led model, with loyalty customers delivering **55% of orders** and **53% of revenue.**
- In **2022,** during the downturn, loyalty still contributed **52% of orders** and **55% of revenue**, indicating resilience among members.

### 3. Product Mix and Refund Risk

- The **27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor** delivers about **9.78M** from **23.2K orders,** with AOV around **$421** and a refund rate of **6.2%** making it a high-value, mid-risk hero product.
- **Apple Airpods** generate around **$7.74M** from **48.4K orders,** with AOV around **$160** and a refund rate of **5.4%,** aligning with a high-volume, mid-ticket profile.
- **MacBook Air** and **ThinkPad** laptops together generate about **$9.5M** from around **6.9K orders,** with AOV between **$1.1K** and **$1.6K** and refund rates between **11.4%** and **11.8%,** representing high revenue concentration with elevated return risk.
- **Samsung charging cables** were a low-risk volume stabilizer, contributing about **0.44M** from **21.9K orders,**  with an AOV near **$20** and a very low refund rate of **1.3%.**

## Deep-Dive Insights
### 1. Sales Performance Trends
At a monthly level, the revenue curve amplifies the annual picture:
- During **2020,** revenue peaks in **December** at **$1.25M,** with **AOV of $311,** reflecting strong seasonal demand.
- In **2021,** revenue remains relatively high but less extreme, consistent with "normalization" after a pandemic-driven bump.
- In **2022,** revenue appears to decline over the year, falling from **$1.69M in Q1** to **$0.65M in Q4,** indicating a progressive slowdown in demand.

This temporal trend suggests that 2020 shoud be treated as an **upside scenario**, 2021 as a **more stable reference**, and 2022 as a **stress-test for downside planning**.

### 2. Loyalty Program Dynamics and Customer Value
The loyalty program's journey from 2019 to 2020 can be summarized as "rapid adoption, mixed efficiency, strong resilience":
- Early in the period, loyalty has **low penetration** and similar economics to non-loyalty customers. By 2020, loyalty drives more than a **third of orders.**
- Across all four years, loyalty customers **spend slightly less per order** and exhibit **higher refund rates,** implying that loyalty benefits and targeting may be encouraging additional purchases, including some marginal or more experimental orders.
- The key inflection is in **2022,** where loyalty customers **outperform in AOV ($245 vs $214)** and deliver **more than half of revenue** in a downturn, acting as a **stabilizing base** when acquisition or casual traffic weakens.

From a strategic view, the program's lifetime value impact is likely positive but would benefit from **tighter targeting and a more refund-aware design.**

## Deep-Dive Insights
### 1. Sales Trends & Growth Rates
#### **Yearly Trends & Growth Rates**
From  2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite averaged approximately **7M annually** from **27K orders per year**, with an **average yearly AOV of $260**. The pandemic year, 2020, saw unprecedented performance and growth (**Revenue: $10M (+163% YoY), Orders: 34K (+101% YoY), AOV: $300 (+31% YoY)**), significantly exceeding the 2019 baseline (**Revenue: $4M, Orders: 17K, AOV: $230**). Order volume peaked in 2021 (**36K (+6% YoY)**); however, declining AOV (**$255 (-10% YoY)**) led to decreased revenue (**$9M (-10% YoY)**. By 2022, market normalization became evident, with declines across all key metrics (**Revenue: $5M (-46% YoY), Orders: 22K (-40% YoY), AOV: $230 (-10% YoY)**), bringing performance closer to 2019 baseline/pre-pandemic levels.
#### **Monthly Trends & Growth Rates**
**March 2020** had exceptional growth (**Revenue: $720K (+50% MoM), Orders: 2.4K (+46% MoM), AOV: $299 (+3% MoM)**), driven by early-pandemic online purchasing. Following this, monthly AOVs gradually normalized, stabilizing by 2022 at pre-pandemic averages (**~$220-$240**).
##### **Seasonality**
- **Peak Months**: Historically, **December** consistently had the highest monthly sales performance each year—most notably in **December 2020 (Revenue: $1.25M, Orders: 4K, AOV: $311)**. However, there was a notable shift in 2022, when **January** emerged as the top-performing month (**Revenue: $705K, Orders: 3K**), reflecting evolving consumer purchasing behaviors.
- **Low Months**: **October and February** regularly saw lower sales. **October 2022** was particularly weak, with significant YoY declines (**Revenue: $178K, -72% YoY; Orders: 825, down from 2.5K YoY; AOV: $216**). This pronounced decline represents an unusual deviation from expected seasonal patterns that warrants further investigation.

### 2. Loyalty Program Performance
Initially accounting for just **12% of revenue and orders in 2019**, loyalty program adoption accelerated rapidly. By **2021**, loyalty orders and revenue had surpassed non-loyalty, reaching **55% of orders** and **53% of revenue**, respectively. During the peak pandemic year (**2020**), loyalty customers became critical to revenue stability, contributing **29% of revenue** and **38% of orders**.
While the average order value (**AOV**) for loyalty customers trailed non-loyalty customers from **2019 to 2022** — **$240** vs. **$275**, respectively — a year-by-year view reveals a promising shift. By **2022**, loyalty AOV had **surpassed** non-loyalty, with loyalty customers spending an average of **$30 more per order** (**$245** vs. **$214**). This higher monthly AOV was sustained **from April 2021 through September 2022**.
Amid **2022’s market normalization** following pandemic-driven surges, loyalty customers continued to show **notable resilience**, representing a consistent majority share of both **revenue (55%)** and **orders (52%)**. These trends underscore the **strategic importance and profitability** of the loyalty program, supporting further investment in its continued growth.

### 3. Refund & Product Performance
From **2019–2022**, refunds represented **5% of total orders** (5K orders) and accounted for **8% of total revenue** ($2M). Rates **peaked in 2020** (**9% of orders**, **13% of revenue**) amid heightened pandemic-driven demand, stabilizing in subsequent years. Notably, **zero refunds were reported in 2022**, suggesting possible data incompleteness or cut-off (refunds may not be recorded yet).

#### By Product
- **Highest Refund Rates**: High-value laptops (**MacBook Air, ThinkPad**) consistently saw elevated refund rates (~**12%**).
- **Highest Refund Volumes**: Best-sellers (**Apple AirPods, 27In 4K Gaming Monitor**) contributed substantially to total refund volumes (**49%** and **27%**, respectively), likely due to their high sales.
- **Highest Refund Values**: Higher-priced items (**MacBook Air, 4K Gaming Monitor**) significantly impacted refunded revenue (**33%** and **28%**, respectively).

#### Apple Products Insights
Apple products (**MacBook Air, AirPods, iPhone**) collectively comprised **53% of refunded revenue** and **58% of refunded orders** from 2019–2022:
