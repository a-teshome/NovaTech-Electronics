<img width="1000" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f24bb623-c9a7-4f60-b225-c4decda88e41">

### Company Background
Tech-E-Suite Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories, selling via website and mobile app since late 2018. Our catalog is centered on leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by performance marketing, SEO, affiliate partnerships, and analytics-led optimization.

### Stakeholder Request
Leadership requested a 2019-2022 performance review to support an upcoming company-wide town hall, with focus on:
- **Revenue and growth trends:** yearly and monthly trends in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).
- **Loyalty program evaluation:** adoption, revenue contribution, and impact on performance, especially during the recent downturn.
- **Refunds and product performance:** refund rates and AOV across products, with focus on **Apple** products. 

# Executive Summary
From **2019 through 2022**, Tech-E-Suite moved through three distinct phases: **initial scale-up**, a **pandemic-driven spike**, and a **post-pandemic correction**. Revenue grew from **$3.87M in 2019** to a **$10.2M peak in 2020 (+163% YoY)**, softened to **$9.13M in 2021 (-10% YoY)**, and then declined to **$4.96M in 2022 (-46% YoY)**. Order volume followed the same pattern, and AOV ranged from **$230 to $300** across the period, with an overall average of **$260**.

The **loyalty program** transitioned from a niche feature to a **core driver of demand**. Loyalty’s share of orders rose from **12% of orders in 2019** to **over 50% of orders and revenue by 2021.** While **loyalty customers** showed slightly lower AOV and higher refund rates than non-loyalty overall, they were **higher value and more resilient in 2022**, contributing the **majority of revenue in a weak year**.

**Product performance** was concentrated in a small set of SKUs. **Mid-ticket hero products** such as **Apple AirPods** and **27-inch monitors** generated substantial revenue with **mid-single-digit refund rates**. **High-ticket laptops (Macbook Air, ThinkPad)** delivered significant top-line but had **double-digit refund rates** and therefore require tighter management. Regionally, **North America** dominated revenue, **APAC** showed the highest AOV, and some orders are not mapped to regions due **to country-code issues**.

## High Level Insights
### 1. Business Trajectory Across the Pandemic Period
Across **2019-2022**, Tech-E-Suite generated **$28.1M** from **108K orders**, with an **aggregate AOV of $260**.
- A **pre-pandemic baseline in 2019** with modest scale and **AOV of $230**.
- A **pronounced pandemic uplift in 2020**, with **revenue and orders more than doubling YoY** and **AOV peaking to $300**, consistent with sector-wide shifts to online electronics purchases.
- A **normalization phase in 2021**, with slightly higher order volume but lower revenue and AOV, suggesting increased **discounting or mix shift*** to lower-priced items.
- A **post-pandemic downturn in 2022** with materially lower revenue and volume compared to prior years.

### 2. Structural Role of Loyalty and Customer Segments
Over the four-year window, the **loyalty program** evolves from a small contributor to a structural pillar:
- Loyalty’s **share of orders and revenue** moved from **low double digits in 2019** to a **clear majority by 2021-2022**.
- Aggregated over 2019-2022, **loyalty customers** had slightly **lower AOV** and **higher refund rates** than non-loyalty, but they accounted for a **disproportionate share of revenue in 2022** and maintained relatively **higher AOV in the downturn year**.

This indicates that loyalty customers behaved as a **more stable demand segment across cycles**, even if their per-order economics were somewhat less favorable on a purely transactional basis.

### 3. Product, Brand, and Regional Mix
The portfolio is heavily skewed toward a **handful of products and brands**:
- **Apple products** account for **45% of orders** but a smaller share of revenue due to **lower AOV**; **non-Apple products** drive fewer orders but **higher revenue per order**.
- A small number of **mid-ticket products (AirPods, 27-inch monitors)** and **high-ticket laptops (Macbook Air, ThinkPad) explain the **majority of revenue**.
- **North America** is the main revenue region then **EMEA**; **APAC** has the **highest AOV**; **LATAM** is smaller and more value-oriented. A non-trivial volume of orders is **not mapped to a region** due to **country-code issues.**

## Deep-Dive Insights
### 1. Time-Series Performance
On a yearly basis, the revenue curve was **non-linear**:
- **2019 baseline**: **$3.87M revenue** from *16.8K orders*, with an *AOV of $230**
- **2020 pandemic spike**: Revenue was **$10.2M (+163% YoY)** from **33.8K orders (+101% YoY)**, with **AOV $300**; refund rate also peaked in this year (**To what**).
- **2021 normalization**: Revenue was **$9.13M (-10% YoY)** from **35.9K orders (+6% YoY)**, while **AOV fell to $255 USD**.
- **2022 downturn**: **$4.96M revenue (-46% YoY)** from **$21.6K orders (-40% YoY)**, with **AOV returning to $230**.

Intra-year patterns reinforce the downturn conclusion for 2022:
- In **2022**, **revenue declined** from **$1.69M in Q1** to **$0.65M in Q4**, implying a substantial **negative trend in quarterly run-rate**.
- **December 2020** was the largest month across all four years, with **$1.25M revenue** and **AOV of $300.**

### 2. Loyalty Program Dynamics and Customer Value
A more structured segmentation of **loyalty vs non-loyalty** suggests:
- **Adoption trajectory**: loyalty share of orders increased from **12% in 2019** to **high-30s in 2020**, to **mid-50s by 2021-2022**, a clear upward trend in program penetration (**positive YoY adoption**).
- **Revenue contribution**: loyalty’s revenue share follows a similar curve, reaching **>50% by 2021-2022**.
- **AOV and refund rates (2019-2022)**:
  - Loyalty: AOV $240, refund rate 6.2%.
  - Non-loyalty: AOV $275, refund rate 4.1%.
- **2022 differential**: loyalty AOV $245 vs $214 for non-loyalty, and loyalty contributes **> 50% of 2022 revenue** despite the downturn.

Analytically, **loyalty membership** was associated with:
- **Higher order frequency** (implicit in the growing share of orders).
- **Slightly worse per-order economics** (lower AOV and higher refund rate when aggregated), but **improved relative value in the downturn year (2022)**.

### 3. Product and Refund Behavior (Apple Focus)
At the **brand level**:
- **Apple products** generated **48.7K orders (45%)** and **$8M in revenue (29%)**, with **AOV of $163** and a **refund rate of 5.5%**.
- **Non-Apple products** generated **$20.2M** from **59.4K orders**, with **AOV of $339** and **refund rate of 4.6%**.

The higher AOV and slightly lower refund rate for **non-Apple** suggests that:
- **Apple** was the **volume engine** at mid-price points.
- **Non-Apple** (notably laptops and monitors) was the **margin-sensitive, high-ticket** part of the portfolio.

At the **SKU level**, a simple tiering is useful:
- **High-ticket laptops**: Macbook Air and ThinkPad generated **$9.5M** from **6.9K orders**, with **AOV** in the **$1,100–1,600** range and **refund rates** in the **11–12%** range. These are **high-value but high-risk** products.
- **Mid-ticket heroes**: AirPods and monitors generated **over $17M in revenue** at **AOV between $160 and $420**, with **mid-single-digit refund rates**.
- **Low-ticket accessories**: Samsung cable packs generated **$0.44M** at **AOV of $20**, with **very low refund rates (~1.3%)**.

The inference about description clarity and accessory compatibility arose because:
- **Apple’s refund rate** was modestly higher than **non-Apple’s**, and Apple’s SKU mix includes many **devices and accessories** where **compatibility, feature expectations, and ecosystem fit** are common friction points.
- However, this was a **hypothesis** based on pattern and product type, not directly observed from return reason codes. To validate, Operations should analyze structured refund reasons and customer support logs.

### 4. Regional Performance and Data Quality
- **North America** was the primary revenue engine ($13.3M), with **AOV of $262**.
- **EMEA** was the **second-largest region** (**$8.2M**), with similar AOV to North America.
- **APAC** had lower total revenue but the highest AOV (**$279**), indicating a more premium mix.
- **LATAM** was smallest in both revenue and AOV (**$231**).

> Around **5K orders cannot be mapped to a region due to country-code issues**, which limits precision in any region-level trend analysis.

## Recommendations
### Leadership & Strategy
- Use **2021 as the primary run-rate baseline** for planning, with **2020 as an upside (pandemic-boosted) scenario** and **2022 as a downside / stress-test scenario**.
- Explicitly factor **pandemic-driven demand distortion in 2020** into any long-term growth targets, avoiding simple linear extrapolation from the **2020 peak**.
- Sponsor a cross-functional review of **high-ticket laptops**, given their **concentration of revenue** and **elevated refund rates**.

### Marketing & CRM
- For **loyalty**: optimize program incentives toward **mid-ticket hero products** (**AirPods, 27-inch monitors**) and **low-refund accessories** to improve **loyalty unit economics** while preserving resilience.
- For **acquisition**: use **non-loyalty high-value profiles** (higher AOV, lower refund rate) to refine **lookalike targeting**; adjust messaging by region (**premium positioning in APAC, value-led in LATAM**).
- Integrate **refund-rate KPIs** into campaign performance dashboards so that volume growth is evaluated jointly with **post-purchase behavior**.

### Product & Merchandising
- Prioritize **mid-ticket hero products** as the core of **promotional calendars**, using **laptops as high-intent, more selectively promoted items**.
- Improve **product discovery and configuration support** for laptops (comparisons, spec explanations, compatibility guidance) to address potential **expectation gaps** that may be driving returns.
- Develop **bundles** that pair **high-ticket devices** with **low-refund accessories and support services** to increase **perceived value** and potentially lower **refund incidence**.

### Operations, Customer Experience & Data
- Conduct a structured **deep dive into refund drivers** for **high-ticket laptops** and **Apple SKUs** using **reason codes and support transcripts**.
- Implement targeted **post-purchase journeys** for **high-value orders** (proactive setup help, check-ins) to **reduce avoidable returns**.
- **Validate and backfill 2022 refund data** and **standardize country codes** to close known **data gaps** and enable more robust **longitudinal and regional analysis**.

## Caveats & Next Steps
### Caveats
- The dataset covers **2019-2022 only**.
- **Refund timestamps are not populated for 2022**, so **refund-rate metrics for that year cannot be interpreted**.
- **Cost, margin, and marketing spend** are not included, so this is a **revenue-focused view** rather than a **profitability analysis**.
- Incomplete **country-to-region mapping** means region-level metrics exclude a subset of orders.

### Next Steps
- Refresh the dataset with **2023-2024 orders**, complete **refund information for 2022 onward**, and fully mapped **country/region data**, then rerun the core t**ime-series and segmentation analysis**.
- Extend the reporting stack to **margin-based and campaign-level views** to assess **profitability**, not just revenue, across **products, regions, and customer segments**.
- Develop a follow-on **customer analytics project** focused on **cohort, repeat behavior, and loyalty tenure** to better quantify **lifetime value** and inform long-term **retention strategy**.
