<img width="1000" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f24bb623-c9a7-4f60-b225-c4decda88e41">

### Company Background
Tech-E-Suite Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories, selling via website and mobile app since late 2018. The catalog is centered on leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by performance marketing, SEO, affiliate partnerships, and analytics-led optimization.

### Stakeholder Request
Leadership requested a 2019-2022 walkthrough of order volume and revenue trends for an upcoming company-wide town hall, focusing on:
- **Revenue and growth trends:** overall, yearly, and monthly trends in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).
- **Loyalty program evaluation:** adoption, revenue contribution, and impact on performance, especially during the recent downturn.
- **Refunds and product performance:** refund rates and AOV across key products, with a specific lens on **Apple**. 

# Executive Summary
From **2019 to 2022**, Tech-E-Suite processed **108K orders** and generated **$28M in revenue**, with an **overall AOV of $260**. During this time, revenue rose from **$3.87M in 2019** to a **$10.2M peak in 2020 (+163% YoY)**, softened to **$9.13M in 2021 (-10% YoY)**, and then declined to **$4.96M in 2022 (-46% YoY)**. Order volume followed the same pattern and AOV ranged from **$230 to $300** across this period.

The **loyalty program** transitioned from a niche feature to a **core driver of demand**. Loyalty’s share grew from **12% in 2019** to **over 50% of orders and revenue by 2021**, a level that was sustained through **2022**. While loyalty customers were initially lower-value and higher-refund than non-loyalty, their AOV rose steadily, and by 2022 loyalty AOV (**$245**) exceeded non-loyalty (**$214**), with loyalty members contributing the majority of revenue and orders in the 2022 downturn.

**Product performance** was concentrated in a small set of SKUs and brands. Apple products accounted for **about half of order volume and revenue**, with slightly higher AOV and refund rates than non-Apple SKUs. **Mid-priced, high-performing products** such as **Apple AirPods** and **monitors** generated substantial revenue with **mid-range refund rates (6-8%)**, while **higher-priced laptops (MacBook Air, ThinkPad)** delivered significant top-line but had **higher refund rates (13–14%)**. Regionally, **North America** was the core revenue and order volume region, while **APAC** showed the highest AOV and an opportunity for expansion. Across platforms, the **website** handled the majority of transactions with high AOV and higher refund rates, while the **mobile app** grew in volume but remained focused on lower-priced purchases.

Overall, the findings supports **continuing the loyalty program, leaning into high-performing seasons and mid-priced, high-performing products**, and **tightening controls around high-refund laptops and certain Apple SKUs**.

# Deep-Dive Insights
## 1. Sales trends and growth rates
- In **2019**, Tech-E-Suite generated **$3.87M** from **16.8K orders** at an **AOV of $230**. Monthly revenue generally ranged between **$250K and $460K** and served as the pre-pandemic baseline.
- In **2020**, revenue surged to **$10.15M (+163% YoY)** with **33.8K orders (+101% YoY)**, and **AOV increased to $300 (+30% vs 2019)**. Revenue rose sharply in **March 2020 (~$720k, +50% MoM)** and remained above the 2019–2022 monthly average for most of the year, **peaking at ~$1.25M in Dec-2020**, more than 3x a typical 2019 month.
- In **2021**, order volume increased further to **35.9K (+6% YoY)**, but revenue declined to **$9.13M (−10% YoY)** and **AOV dropped to $255 (−15% vs 2020)**, as product mix shifted toward lower-priced orders.

- In **2022**, both revenue and order volume declined to **$4.96M (−46% YoY)** and **21.6K (−40% YoY)**, respectively, with **AOV returning $230**, in line with 2019 levels. Revenue trended downward across 2022; Oct-2022 was the lowest revenue month ($178K, -55% MoM) across the four-year period.

2020 represented an upside scenario, 2022 a downside scenario, and 2021 the most representative baseline for forward planning.

### Monthly trends and seasonality

- **December** and **September** consistently outperformed, with overall average order volume **10–18% above** the four-year monthly average (**2.3K orders**). Like revenue, order volume peaked in **Dec 2020 (4K orders, +46% MoM)**, making these months natural anchor points for major campaigns.
- **February** and **October** consistently underperformed. Similar to revenue, order volume was lowest in **October 2022 (825 orders, -47% MoM)**, combining seasonal weakness with the broader 2022 downturn.

## 2. Loyalty Program performance

### Adoption and revenue contribution
- Loyalty's share of orders grew from **12% in 2019** to the **high-30s in 2020** and then to the **mid-50s in 2021-2022**, reflecting a clear positive YoY trend in program adoption. Loyalty's revenue share followed the same curve, reaching **over 50% of reveneue** in both 2021 and during the 2022 downturn.

### Customer value and refunds
- **Aggregated AOV and refund rates (2019-2022)**: **Loyalty** orders had an **AOV of $240** and a **refund rate of 6.2%**, compared to non-loyalty with **higher AOV ($275)** and lower **refund rate (4.1%)**.
- **Year-level trends**:
  - Non-loyalty orders were more expensive **(AOV: $233 vs $207 (loyalty))** in **2019** and in **2020 (AOV: $345 vs $228 (loyalty))**, as higher-value pandemic purchases skewed toward non-loyalty customers.
  - Compared with 2020, in **2021**, non-loyalty **AOV declined ($261)** but remained above loyalty AOV, which rose to **$249**.
  - By **2022**, loyalty AOV reached **$245**, while non-loyalty AOV continued to decline to **$214**.

Shipping and delivery operations were uniform across segments.

## 3. Product performance

### Brand-level
- Across all four years, **Apple products** drove a large share of both revenue and order volume, generating **$14.3M in revenue (51%)** from **52.7K orders (49%)**, with **AOV of $271** but with higher return risk **(refund rate 7.2%)**.
- **Non-Apple products** accounted for **55.5K orders (51%)** and **$13.9M revenue (49%)**, with an **AOV of $250** and a **refund rate of 5.2%**, making them comparably lower-risk on returns.

### Product-level

- **Monitors** were the top revenue contributors among individual SKUs, generating **$9.85M in revenue** from **23.4K orders**, with **AOV of $421** and a **refund rate of 7.7%**.
- **Laptops** were very high-value but carried elevated refund risk, with refund rates double the overall average.
  - **MacBooks**: **$6.30M** in revenue from **3,964** orders with **AOV $1,590** and **refund rate 13%**.
  - **ThinkPad**: **$3.21M** in revenue from **2,916** orders with **AOV $1,100** and **refund rate 14%**.
- **Apple iPhones** accounted for **$213K revenue** from **288 orders**, with **Aov $741** and **refund rate 9%**.

Shipping and delivery times were consistent across SKUs, so differences in performance were driven by pricing and returns rather than operational delays.

## 4. Regional performance
- **North America** formed the core of the business in both order volume and revenue, generating **$14.6M in revenue** from **56K orders**, with **AOV of $260**.
- **APAC** had the highest AOV (**revenue $3.65M, 13.1K orders, AOV $279**), suggesting opportinities for more premium positioning

## 5. Purchase platform
- The **website** was the primary purchase platform, which was the main source of high-value transactions through 2021-2022.
- The **mobile app** grew in usage (from **1K orders in 2019** to **~9K in 2021**) but was primarily used for smaller, lower-priced purchases, with AOV falling from **~$110** to **~$40** over the period.
- **Refund rates by platform** were higher on the website than on the app, consistent with the website’s concentration of higher-priced and higher-risk products such as laptops..

# Recommendations (by team)
## Marketing & CRM
- Focus loyalty campaigns and promotions in **December** and **September**, leveraging higher seasonal demand and higher loyalty AOV to drive incremental revenue.
- Consider integrating **refund rate KPIs** into campaign reporting for laptops and key Apple products so growth is evaluated on net revenue, not just ROAS.
## Product & Merchandising
- Feature **AirPods and monitors** as core offers in key seasonal campaigns, given their strong revenue and mid-range (**6-8%**) refund rates.
- Consider improving **product discovery and configuration support** for laptops to reduce high refund rates.
- Develop **bundles** pairing **high-ticket devices** (like laptops) with **low-refund accessories** to increase AOV while spread perceived value.
## Customer Experience & Operations
- Run a structured analysis of refund reasons for high refund-rate SKUs (laptops, Apple SKUs) and use the findings to refine product information, onboarding, and support flows.
## Finance & Data
- Investigate potential 2022 refund data gaps and ensure future datasets capture complete refund timestamps for reliable return-rate monitoring.
  
# Caveats
- **Refund data**: Refund timestamps for 2022 are missing. Refund rate analysis is limited to 2019-2021 only.
