## Stakeholder Request
The leadership team requested this analysis ahead of an upcoming company-wide town hall. They seek insights into key business performance indicators from 2019 through 2022. Specifically, this analysis addresses:
- **Revenue and growth trends**: Identifying key yearly and monthly trends in revenue, average order value (AOV), and order volumes.
- **Loyalty program evaluation**: Assessing adoption, revenue impacts, and program performance during recent company downturn.
- **Refunds and product performance**: Examining refund rates, AOV, and product-level performance, with a focus on Apple products.

# Executive Summary: Ecommerce Performance Analysis (2019-2022)
## Overview of Findings
Over the 2019–2022 period, Tech-E-Suite generated **$28M in total revenue** from **over 108K orders**, maintaining an **average AOV of $260**. Peak-pandemic conditions significantly boosted 2020 performance, with subsequent years reflecting market normalization and fluctuations in consumer purchasing behaviors. The loyalty program adoption steadily increased, effectively supporting business revenue during downturns, despite lower average order values among loyalty users. Product-wise, Apple items notably contributed significant revenues at higher AOVs but showed varying refund rates, which warrant further analysis. Notably, the lack of refunds data for 2022 potentially indicates missing data or other underlying operational issues requiring attention..

# Deep-Dive Insights
## 1. Sales Trends & Growth Rates
- **Yearly Trends & Growth Rates**: From  2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite averaged approximately **7M annually** from **27K orders per year**, with an **average yearly AOV of $260**. The peak-pandemic year, 2020, saw unprecedented performance and growth (**Revenue: $10M (+163% YoY), Orders: 34K (+101% YoY), AOV: $300 (+31% YoY)**), significantly exceeding 2019 baseline (**Revenue: $4M, Orders: 17K, AOV: $230**). Order volumes peaked in 2021 (**36K (+6% YoY)**), however, declining AOV (**$255 (-10% YoY)**) led to reduced revenue (**$9M (-10% YoY)**. By 2022, market normalization became evident, with declines across all key metrics (**Revenue: $5M (-46% YoY), Orders: 22K (-40% YoY), AOV: $230 (-10% YoY)**), bringing performance closer to 2019/pre-pandemic baseline.
- **Monthly Trends & Growth Rates**: **March 2020** had exceptional growth (**Revenue: $720K (+50% MoM), Orders: 2.4K (+46% MoM), AOV: $299 (+3% MoM)**), driven by pandemic-induced demand spikes.
  - **Seasonality**: **December** typically had high monthly sales, with the highest in **2020 (Revenue: $1.25M, Orders: 4K, AOV: $311)**. In **2022**, however, this shifted significantly, with **January** surpassing December as the top-performing month (**Revenue: $705K vs. $262K; Orders: 3K vs. 1K**). Recurring monthly lows appeared consistently in **October and February**, with **October 2022 experiencing an unprecedented decline (Revenue: $178K, -72% YoY; Orders: 825, down from 2.5K YoY; AOV: $216)**. Post-pandemic, monthly AOVs stabilized to pre-pandemic levels (**~$220–$240**), reflecting normalization in consumer behavior.

> Strategic Recommendation
The unusual revenue decline in October 2022 warrants further investigation to pinpoint root causes. A targeted exploration into product mix variations, geographic region impacts, or shifts in marketing effectiveness will yield actionable insights to prevent future performance drops during critical months.

## Loyalty Program Evaluation
Initially comprising just **12% of users and orders in 2019**, loyalty adoption grew significantly surpassing non-loyalty by 2021 (**56% loyalty vs. 44% non-loyalty**). During the peak-pandemic growth of 2020, loyalty customers contributed substantially (**29% of revenue, 38% of orders**), **becoming essential to revenue stability**. In subsequent downturn periods (particularly 2022), loyalty members showed resilience, consistently accounting for a greater proportion of total revenue (**55%**) and orders (**52%**) compared to non-loyalty members. However, throughout the analysis period, loyalty customers averaged slightly lower AOVs (**$240**) compared to non-loyalty (**$275**). Nonetheless, the steady revenue stream provided by loyalty customers, especially during challenging market conditions, validates continued strategic investment in the loyalty program.

## Refund Impact
>> Angie: For refunds and average order value, would like to focus on how these metrics compare across Apple products. Also include number of refunds as a metric.

Refunds represented **5% of total orders** (~5K orders) and **8% of total revenue** (~$2M) from 2019 to 2022. Rates significantly peakied in 2020 (**9% orders, 13% revenue**) likely due to pandemic-driven sales spike, before stabilizing in 2021.
