<img width="1000" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f24bb623-c9a7-4f60-b225-c4decda88e41">

### Company Background
Tech-E-Suite Electronics is a global e-commerce retailer specializing in premium consumer electronics and accessories, selling via website and mobile app since late 2018. The catalog is centered on leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad and growth is driven by performance marketing, SEO, affiliate partnerships, and analytics-led optimization.

### Stakeholder Request
Leadership requested a 2019-2022 walkthrough of sales performance for an upcoming company-wide town hall, focusing on:
- Overall trends and growth rates in revenue, order volume, and average order value (AOV).
- Loyalty program evaluation: adoption, revenue contribution, and impact on performance, especially during a recent downturn.
- Refunds and product performance, with a specific focus on **Apple** products.

**Key Question**: How can Tech-E-Suite retain as much of the value captured in **2020–2021** as possible in a **2022-style demand environment**? 

# Executive Summary
From **2019 to 2022**, Tech-E-Suite processed **108K orders** and generated **$28M in revenue**, with an **overall AOV of $260**. Revenue rose from **$3.87M in 2019** to a **$10.2M peak in 2020 (+163% YoY)**, softened to **$9.13M in 2021 (-10% YoY)**, and then declined to **$4.96M in 2022 (-46% YoY)**. Order volume followed a similar pattern and AOV ranged from **$230 to $300** across the period.

The **loyalty program** evolved from a niche feature to a **core driver of demand**. Loyalty’s share of orders grew from **12% in 2019** to **the high-30s in 2020**, and **mid-50s in 2021-2022**, with loyalty contributing **over 50% of revenue** in 2021 and 2022. While loyalty customers were initially lower-value than non-loyalty, their AOV rose over time; by 2022, loyalty AOV (**$245**) exceeded non-loyalty (**$214**), and loyalty members contributed the majority of revenue in a weak year.

Across products, Apple SKUs accounted for **about half of order volume and revenue**, with slightly higher AOV and higher refund rates than non-Apple SKUs. **Mid-priced, high-performing products** like **Apple AirPods** and **27-inch monitors** generated substantial revenue with **mid-range refund rates (6-8%)**, while **higher-priced laptops (MacBook Air, ThinkPad)** delivered significant revenue but had **higher refund rates (13–14%)**. Together, these four SKUs accounted for **$27M (96% of total revenue)**, indicating the portfolio was effectively anchored on a small product set. **North America** was the core region by revenue and orders, while **APAC** had the highest AOV and was a clear premium opportunity for expansion. The **website** handled most high-value orders across purchase platforms, while the **mobile app** grew in volume but remained focused on lower-priced purchases.

Overall, the findings support **continuing the loyalty program, leaning into high-performing seasons and mid-priced, high-performing products**, and **tightening controls around high-refund laptops and certain Apple SKUs**.

# Key Insights
## 1. Sales trends and seasonality: 2020 spike, 2022 reset
2020 was the breakout year for Tech-E-Suite, but by 2022 revenue, orders, and AOV had effectively reset to 2019 levels, with December and September consistently driving the strongest performance.

**Yearly summary (2019–2022)**:
- **2020 breakout**: Revenue and orders grew **+163% YoY** and **+101% YoY**, respectively, and AOV and refund rate **peak at $300** and **9.2%**, signaling higher return exposure during the surge.
- **Post-2020 decline**: Revenue fell in **2021 (-10% YoY)** and **2022 (-46% YoY)**, while orders grew **6% in 2021** then dropped **40% in 2022**. AOV declined from **$300 → $255 → $230**, back to baseline.
- **Refunds (data-limited)**: Refund rates declined from **6% (2019)** to **3–4% (2021)** but **2022 refund timestamps are missing** - needs further investigation.

**Monthly performance and seasonality**:
**Key peaks**:
- **March 2020** had the largest MoM increase in revenue **($720K (+50% MoM))** from **2.4K orders**.
- **December 2020** was the strongest month overall **($1.25M revenue, 4K orders)**, setting the peak for both revenue and order volume.

Seasonality had a stable pattern across years:
- **Strongest months**: **December** and **September** averaged 2.7K and 2.6K orders, roughly 10–18% above the monthly average of 2.3K orders, and peaked at 4K and 3.6K orders in 2020, making them natural anchor points for major campaigns.

Weakest months: February and October averaged 1.8K orders, about 20% below the monthly average; Oct 2022 (825 orders, −47% MoM) combined seasonal weakness with overall demand softness.

## 2. Loyalty Program performance

<img width="926" height="272" alt="Loyalty share and aov" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14e9c86b-0a1b-46d3-bcc7-e3bcccc50a1c" />

Loyalty's share of orders grew from **12% in 2019** to the **high-30s in 2020** and then to the **mid-50s in 2021-2022**, showing a clear positive YoY trend in program adoption. Revenue share followed the same pattern, crossing **50%** in **2021** and remaining **above 50% in 2022** - more than half of Tech-E-Suite's revenue came from loyalty members in the latter two years.

Across **2019-2022**, loyalty orders had an **AOV of $240** and a **refund rate of 6.2%**, compared with non-loyalty orders with **higher AOV ($275)** and **lower refund rate (4.1%)**. In **2019-2020**, non-loyalty orders were meaningfully higher-value **(AOV $233 vs $207 in 2019; $345 vs $228 in 2020)**, as higher-priced pandemic purchases (including laptops and iPhones) skewed toward non-loyalty customers. In **2021**, non-loyalty AOV eased to **$261** while loyalty AOV rose to **$249**. By **2022**, loyalty AOV reached **$245** while non-loyalty AOV fell to **$214**, and loyalty contributed more than half of revenue. Across all 4 years, loyalty AOV **declined less and recovered faster than non-loyalty AOV**, making loyalty value more resilient over time.

Overall, loyalty membership was associated with **higher order frequency** and slight

## 3. Product performance

At the brand level, **Apple products** generated **$14.3M in revenue (51%)** from **52.7K orders (49%)**, with **AOV $271** but with higher return risk **(refund rate 7.2%)**. **Non-Apple products** accounted for **55.5K orders (51%)** and **$13.9M revenue (49%)**, with an **AOV $250** and a **refund rate of 5.2%**, making them lower-risk on returns compared to Apple.

Within the catalog, a few SKUs drove most of the performance. The **27-in 4K monitor** was the top individual revenue driver **($9.85M revenue, 23.4K orders, AOV $421, refund rate of 7.7%)**. The laptops, **MacBook Air ($6.30M, 4K orders, AOV $1,590, refund rate 13%)** and **ThinkPad ($3.21M, 2.9K orders, AOV $1,100, refund rate 14%)**, were very high-value but had refund rates roughly **double the overall average**. **Apple AirPods ($7.74M, 48.4K orders, AOV $160, refund rate 6.7%)** were the most popular product, ideal for attach opportunities. Together, these 4 products accounted for **$27M (96%) in revenue**. Coincidentally, all **Apple iPhone** orders were made by **non-loyalty customers** and contributed **$213K (288 orders, AOV $741, refund rate 9%)**.

## 4. Reach
Regionally, **North America** was the core market, with **$14.6M in revenue (52%)** from **56K orders**, with **AOV $260**. **APAC** generated **$3.65M** from **13.1K orders** but had the **highest AOV ($279**), suggesting a more premium mix and opportunity to test higher-end positioning. Four countries (US, GB, CA and JP) generated over 60% of total revenue.

# Recommendations (by team)
### Marketing & CRM
- Focus loyalty campaigns and promotions in **December** and **September**, when demand and loyalty AOV are both higher.
- Add **refund rate metrics** for laptops and key Apple products to campaign reporting so performance is evaluated on net revenue, not just ROAS.

### Product & Merchandising
- Feature **AirPods and monitors** as lead offers in key seasonal campaigns, given their strong revenue and **mid-range** (**6-8%**) **refund rates**.
- Improve **laptop product discovery and configuration support** to help reduce high refund rates.
- Develop **bundles** pairing **high-ticket devices** (like laptops) with **low-refund accessories** (like cable packs) to increase AOV and improve perceived value.

### Customer Experience & Operations
- Run a structured analysis on refund reasons for high refund-rate SKUs (laptops, Apple SKUs) and use the findings to refine product information and onboarding flows.

### Finance & Data
- Investigate potential 2022 refund data gaps and ensure future datasets capture complete refund timestamps for reliable return-rate monitoring.
  
# Caveats
- **Refund data**: Refund timestamps for 2022 are missing. Refund rate analysis is limited to 2019-2021 only.
