# Deep-Dive Insights
## 1. Sales Trends & Growth Rates
### **Yearly Trends & Growth Rates**
From  2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite averaged approximately **7M annually** from **27K orders per year**, with an **average yearly AOV of $260**. The peak-pandemic year, 2020, saw unprecedented performance and growth (**Revenue: $10M (+163% YoY), Orders: 34K (+101% YoY), AOV: $300 (+31% YoY)**), significantly exceeding the 2019 baseline (**Revenue: $4M, Orders: 17K, AOV: $230**). Order volumes peaked in 2021 (**36K (+6% YoY)**); however, declining AOV (**$255 (-10% YoY)**) led to reduced revenue (**$9M (-10% YoY)**. By 2022, market normalization became evident, with declines across all key metrics (**Revenue: $5M (-46% YoY), Orders: 22K (-40% YoY), AOV: $230 (-10% YoY)**), bringing performance closer to 2019 baseline/pre-pandemic levels.
### **Monthly Trends & Growth Rates**
**March 2020** had exceptional growth (**Revenue: $720K (+50% MoM), Orders: 2.4K (+46% MoM), AOV: $299 (+3% MoM)**), driven by pandemic-induced online shopping spikes. Historically, **December** typically represented annual sales peaks, especially evident **December 2020** (**Revenue: $1.25M, Orders: 4K, AOV: $311**). In 2022, a shift occurred, with **January surpassing December** (**Revenue: $705K vs. $262K; Orders: 3K vs. 1K**). Regularly weaker months included **October and February**, with **October 2022** experiencing unprecedented decline (**Revenue: $178K, -72% YoY; Orders: 825, down from 2.5K, AOV: $216**). Post-pandemic, AOVs stabilized at pre-pandemic averages (**~$220-$240**).
#### **Seasonality**
**December** typically had high monthly sales, with the highest in **2020 (Revenue: $1.25M, Orders: 4K, AOV: $311)**. In **2022**, however, this shifted significantly, with **January** surpassing December as the top-performing month (**Revenue: $705K vs. $262K; Orders: 3K vs. 1K**). Recurring monthly lows appeared consistently in **October and February**, with **October 2022 experiencing an unprecedented decline (Revenue: $178K, -72% YoY; Orders: 825, down from 2.5K YoY; AOV: $216)**. Post-pandemic, monthly AOVs stabilized to pre-pandemic levels (**~$220–$240**), reflecting normalization in consumer behavior.
- **Peak Months**: Consistent annual peaks in December, shifting to January in 2022.
- **Low Months**: Recurrent lower performance in October and February. 

> Strategic Recommendation
The unusual revenue decline in October 2022 warrants further investigation to pinpoint root causes. A targeted exploration into product mix variations, geographic region impacts, or shifts in marketing effectiveness will yield actionable insights to prevent future performance drops during critical months.

## Loyalty Program Evaluation
Initially comprising just **12% of users and orders in 2019**, loyalty adoption grew significantly surpassing non-loyalty share by 2021 (**56% loyalty vs. 44% non-loyalty**). During the peak-pandemic growth of 2020, loyalty customers contributed substantially (**29% of revenue, 38% of orders**), **becoming essential to revenue stability**. In subsequent downturn periods (particularly 2022), loyalty members showed resilience, consistently accounting for a greater proportion of total revenue (**55%**) and orders (**52%**) compared to non-loyalty members. However, throughout the analysis period, loyalty customers averaged slightly lower AOVs (**$240**) compared to non-loyalty (**$275**). Nonetheless, the steady revenue stream provided by loyalty customers, especially during challenging market conditions, validates continued strategic investment in the loyalty program.

## Refund Impact
>> Angie: For refunds and average order value, would like to focus on how these metrics compare across Apple products. Also include number of refunds as a metric.

Refunds represented **5% of total orders** (~ 5K orders) and **8% of total revenue** (~ $2M) from 2019 to 2022. Refund rates peaked significantly in 2020 (**9% orders, 13% revenue**), due the substantial pandemic-driven sales surge, before stabilizing in 2021. Notably, zero refunds were reported for 2022, indicating possible data collection or operational gaps requiring investigation.
### By Product
- **Highest Refund Rate**: High-value laptops (**MacBook Air, ThinkPad**) consistently had the highest refund rates (**~12%**).
- **Highest Refund Volume**: Popular products (**Apple AirPods, 4K Gaming Monitor**) represented the majority of refund volume (**49% and 27% of total refunds**, respectively), likely due to their high overall sales.
- **Highest Refund Value**: High-priced items (**MacBook Air, 4K Gaming Monitor**) significantly impacted redunded revenue (**33% and 28% of total refunded revenue**, respectively).

### Apple Products Highlight:
Apple products (**MacBook Air, Apple AirPods**, and **Apple iPhone**) significantly impacted refunds, collectively accounting for **53% of total refunded revenue** and **58% of refunded orders** from 2019-2022:
- **AirPods**: Generated substantial volume (**~48K units sold**) with lower AOVs (**$160**). Refund volumes (**~2,600 refunds, 5.4% refund rate**) exceeded company average.
- **MacBook Air laptops**: Offered significantly higher AOVs (**~$1,588**) but also had a notably higher refund rate (**11%**).
- **Apple iPhones**: Sold in lower volumes (**~288 units**) but had high AOVs (**$741**) and low refund rates (**~7.6%**)
Given these insights, there is an opportunity to reassess product-specific customer satisfaction, return policies, and quality control processes, particularly for higher-value items.

# Strategic Recommendations
### **Product Team**
- Investigate refund drivers and customer dissatisfaction for high refund-rate products (**MacBook Air, ThinkPad laptops**).
### **Operations Team**
- Conduct audits on refund-data collection and reporting processes to determine reasons behing zero-refund records in 2022.
- Streamline returns handling and customer interaction procedures, especially during peak demand periods, to proactively reduce refund volume and rates.
### **Marketing Team**
- Strategically enhance loyalty programs to incentivize higher AOVs among loyalty customers through focused product bundles and exclusive promotions.
- Develop targeted marketing and educational campaigns around high-refund-volume products (**Apple AirPods, Gaming Monitor**) to clearly set customer expectations and improve user satisfaction.
### **Cross-functional Recommendation**
- Conduct a detailed, cross-team investigation into October 2022's substantial performance drop, evaluating product-level sales, regional issues, and marketing effectiveness aiming to identify and mitigate risks ahead of any future challenging periods.
