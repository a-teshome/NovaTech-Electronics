# Deep-Dive Insights
## 1. Sales Trends & Growth Rates
### **Yearly Trends & Growth Rates**
From  2019 to 2022, Tech-E-Suite averaged approximately **7M annually** from **27K orders per year**, with an **average yearly AOV of $260**. The pandemic year, 2020, saw unprecedented performance and growth (**Revenue: $10M (+163% YoY), Orders: 34K (+101% YoY), AOV: $300 (+31% YoY)**), significantly exceeding the 2019 baseline (**Revenue: $4M, Orders: 17K, AOV: $230**). Order volume peaked in 2021 (**36K (+6% YoY)**); however, declining AOV (**$255 (-10% YoY)**) led to decreased revenue (**$9M (-10% YoY)**. By 2022, market normalization became evident, with declines across all key metrics (**Revenue: $5M (-46% YoY), Orders: 22K (-40% YoY), AOV: $230 (-10% YoY)**), bringing performance closer to 2019 baseline/pre-pandemic levels.
### **Monthly Trends & Growth Rates**
**March 2020** had exceptional growth (**Revenue: $720K (+50% MoM), Orders: 2.4K (+46% MoM), AOV: $299 (+3% MoM)**), driven by early-pandemic online purchasing. Following this, monthly AOVs gradually normalized, stabilizing by 2022 at pre-pandemic averages (**~$220-$240**).
#### **Seasonality**
- **Peak Months**: Historically, **December** consistently had the highest monthly sales performance each year—most notably in **December 2020 (Revenue: $1.25M, Orders: 4K, AOV: $311)**. However, there was a notable shift in 2022, when **January** emerged as the top-performing month (**Revenue: $705K, Orders: 3K**), reflecting evolving consumer purchasing behaviors.
- **Low Months**: **October and February** regularly saw lower sales. **October 2022** was particularly weak, with significant YoY declines (**Revenue: $178K, -72% YoY; Orders: 825, down from 2.5K YoY; AOV: $216**). This pronounced decline represents an unusual deviation from expected seasonal patterns that warrants further investigation.

## Loyalty Program Evaluation
Initially comprising just 12% of revenue and orders in 2019, the loyalty program significantly increased its adoption, surpassing non-loyalty share by 2021 (55% loyalty vs. 45% non-loyalty orders; 53% vs. 47% revenue). During peak-pandemic conditions (2020), loyalty members notably boosted their contribution (29% revenue, 38% orders), becoming critical to revenue stability.
While loyalty average order value (AOV) over the full period ($240) trailed non-loyalty ($275), recent data indicates notable improvement. By 2022, loyalty members were spending, on average, $30 more per order than non-loyalty customers ($245 loyalty vs. $214 non-loyalty). Loyalty customers sustained this higher monthly AOV consistently from April 2021 through September 2022.
In the challenging market conditions of 2022, loyalty customers demonstrated resilience, consistently representing the majority share of revenue (55%) and orders (52%). The upward trend in loyalty AOV, coupled with robust order volume, indicates increased profitability and validates ongoing strategic investment in strengthening and expanding the loyalty program.

## Refund Impact
Refunds represented **5% of total orders** (~ 5K orders) and **8% of total revenue** (~ $2M) from 2019 to 2022. Refund rates peaked significantly in 2020 (**9% orders, 13% revenue**), due the substantial pandemic-driven sales surge, before stabilizing in 2021. Notably, zero refunds were reported for 2022, indicating possible data collection or operational gaps requiring investigation.
### By Product
- **Highest Refund Rate**: High-value laptops (**MacBook Air, ThinkPad**) consistently had the highest refund rates (**~12%**).
- **Highest Refund Volume**: Popular products (**Apple AirPods, 4K Gaming Monitor**) represented the majority of refund volume (**49% and 27% of total refunds**, respectively), likely due to their high overall sales.
- **Highest Refund Value**: High-priced items (**MacBook Air, 4K Gaming Monitor**) significantly impacted redunded revenue (**33% and 28% of total refunded revenue**, respectively).

### Apple Products Highlight:
Apple products (**MacBook Air, Apple AirPods**, and **Apple iPhone**) significantly impacted refunds, collectively accounting for **53% of total refunded revenue** and **58% of refunded orders** from 2019-2022:
- **AirPods**: Generated substantial volume (**~48K units sold**) with lower AOVs (**$160**). Refund volumes (**~2,600 refunds, 5.4% refund rate**) exceeded company average.
- **MacBook Air laptops**: Offered significantly higher AOVs (**~$1,588**) but also had a notably higher refund rate (**11%**).
- **Apple iPhones**: Sold in lower volumes (**~288 units**) but had high AOVs (**$741**) and low refund rates (**~7.6%**)
Given these insights, there is an opportunity to reassess product-specific customer satisfaction, return policies, and quality control processes, particularly for higher-value items.
